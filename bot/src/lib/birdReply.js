// The Reply button on a Bird's letter, and the picker it opens. See
// docs/systemdocs/BIRD.md and docs/systemdocs/PAPERWORK.md.
//
// IT IS A PICKER, NOT A MODAL, since paper landed. Replying means handing the
// bird a letter you are already holding — you write it with the Write button on
// your sheet, which has a real text box and no three-second clock on it. What
// this does is choose which of your papers goes back, and a reply can therefore
// go out sealed, which a modal could never have expressed.
//
// This runs in a DM, so there is no guild and no member — nothing here may
// touch interaction.guild or interaction.member. It doesn't need to: the
// BirdMessage row carries both parties as snapshots.
//
// THE WINDOW IS THE WHOLE MECHANIC. A letter can be answered during the turn it
// arrived in and the one after, and then the bird is gone. Both handlers check
// it, not just the button: a player can sit on an open picker across a turn
// boundary, and the submit is the only check that can't be outrun.
