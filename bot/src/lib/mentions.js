// Character-role mentions: who was pinged, may they hear it, and (in a private
// thread) letting them in.
//
// A character's personal Discord role is a mentionable name token —
// Character.discordRoleId is @unique, so a mentioned role id resolves straight
// back to one character. Mentioning a GM/spectator/player role resolves to
// nothing and is silently ignored, which is how non-character roles stay out
// of this path.

// Whether a ping in this channel should reach `character` at all.
//
// The rule is that a ping must not carry further than a voice would, or it
// becomes a free cross-map signalling channel. Two cases, because the two
// kinds of channel mean different things by "in earshot":
//
//   - A Location channel is gated on the location: a shout in the Square
//     does not carry to the Cathedral, because a voice wouldn't.
//   - A zone's #summary belongs to the whole zone rather than any one
//     location, so it stays gated on the zone.
//   - The special channels have no place at all, so they're gated on whether
//     the target currently *hears that channel* under its own rules — which
//     reuses db/lib/specialChannels.js rather than inventing a second copy.
