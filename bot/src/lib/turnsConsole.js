// #turns is one rolling message — announcement, turn banner and the
// Move/Travel buttons on a single post that db/lib/turnAnnouncement.js
// replaces every turn. See the comment there for why it stopped being three
// separate messages.
//
// Speak used to be the third button. Its destination picker could never list a
// Room thread or a Conversation, which is where talk actually happens, so the
// button is gone and /message — which opens the same modal on the channel you
// run it in — is the whole feature now.
//
// This file is now only the COLD START: at ready, make sure that message
// exists at all. It normally does, and this does nothing. It matters for a
// fresh guild that has never advanced a turn, and as the backstop for a
// repost that failed.
//
// Restart Game used to be the case that made this file load-bearing: it
// deletes every message in #turns (db/lib/fullWipe.js) and opens Turn 1
// without advancing a turn, so players faced an empty channel until the next
// dawn or dusk. It reposts the console itself now — see finishGameWipe in
// web/app/(app)/gm/dev/actions.js.

// Re-asserts who can see and speak in #turns (db/lib/turnsChannelAccess.js:
// @everyone denied, every zone role allowed the view, so the channel appears
// the moment a player has a character) and makes sure the console message
// exists, reusing it across restarts rather than reposting.
