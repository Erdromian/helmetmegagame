// Discord has no confirm dialog and this one kills people: the gun in the
// fortress yard does not check who anyone is, so arming it endangers the
// Cerberon, the Baron and whoever happens to be crossing the yard.
//
// The typed word is the confirm. It is deliberate friction — a misclick on a
// red button should not be able to shoot the Keep — and it doubles as the
// place to say, in plain words, what is about to happen.
//
// The room id rides in the customId so the submit handler can re-check where
// the presser is standing. An ephemeral modal outlives somebody walking out of
// the Garrison, so permission is decided at submit, never at open.

// The two words and the matcher live in db/lib/gatehouseTurret.js, so the
// Hall's confirm asks for the same one.
