// Acknowledging and answering a Discord interaction correctly.
//
// Discord gives a bot three seconds to acknowledge an interaction, so `ack`
// must run before any database work, not after. A reply over 2000 characters
// is rejected outright after that work has already committed, so `respond`
// clamps it instead. Every handler that touches the database calls `ack`
// first and answers via `respond`, not `interaction.reply` — the exception is
// a handler that opens a modal, where `showModal` IS the acknowledgement.
//
// `respond` also puts the reply through `ephemeralLine`, so the house format —
// `» *text*` — lives in one place and a call site writes a plain sentence.
