// restarts a crashed container immediately, and every `ready` replays the full
// catch-up burst (refreshLocationChannels, syncNicknamesForGuild,
// ensureTurnsConsole, global command registration — bot/src/events/ready.js).
// A crash loop is therefore the one shape in this codebase that can sustain
// the ~17 invalid-responses/second for ten minutes that trips Discord's
// Cloudflare IP ban; every other path is sequential and bounded. Logging and
// continuing turns "banned for an hour at 4am" into one stderr line.
//
// uncaughtException is deliberately handled the same way rather than
// re-thrown: by the time it fires the gateway connection is usually still
// healthy, and a half-broken bot that keeps serving is better here than a
// restart storm. db/lib/discordRest.js#discordRequest carries a circuit
// breaker as the second line of defence if this assumption is ever wrong.
