// Strips everything that grants a character sight of the game — the zone
// role, and every per-member channel overwrite: the Location channel they
// were standing in, the special channels' grants, and any strays. Used on
// death, on guildMemberRemove, and — in bulk — by Restart Game.
//
// The Location channel sweep is load-bearing now rather than tidy-up. A
// Location wears no Discord role since the overwrite rework, so a dead
// character's sight of the room they died in is an overwrite, and this is
// the only thing that takes it away (the doctor's occupancy check is the
// safety net). allAccessChannelIds() already enumerates every Location
// channel, which is why the shape below did not have to change.
//
// BOTH functions are read-then-delete: one read of the guild's channels (or
// its members) tells you exactly which overwrites and roles are really there,
// and only those are removed. The single-character form used to sweep BLIND —
// two DELETEs against every access channel whether or not an overwrite existed
// — which was ~150 sequential Discord round-trips for a character who stands in
// exactly one Location. Deleting a character took over half a minute of pure
// latency. Read-first costs one call and deletes two or three.
//
// A read that FAILS falls back to the blind sweep rather than skipping the
// half it couldn't see. Silently skipping would leave a departed player still
// reading rooms, which is the whole class of bug the checked return exists to
// catch.
//
// Takes `prisma` as the first parameter (the db/lib/dm.js convention) and is
// deliberately NOT on the @lifeweb/db barrel; require it by path.
//
// Both functions return counts and failure lists rather than nothing:
// a revoke that silently fails leaves a departed player still reading rooms,
// which is exactly the class of bug the zone rework exists to end.
