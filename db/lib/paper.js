// Paper: what a sheet is, what it says, and who gets to find out.
// See docs/systemdocs/PAPERWORK.md.
//
// A written sheet is a Tag row minted at runtime with `custom: true` and
// `ephemeral: true` — the same shape as a crate (db/lib/depotCrates.js) or a
// corpse (db/lib/corpseMint.js), and for the same reason: being a tag buys
// carry weight, transfers, room stashes, theft and looting for free rather
// than needing a parallel inventory.
//
// What makes paper different from every other tag in the catalog is that its
// text is PRIVATE. Every other tag's description is the same sentence for
// everybody; a letter's depends on the reader's eyes and letters. So the text
// lives on Tag.paperText, which TAG_CHIP_FIELDS never selects, and the
// description a viewer actually sees is composed here, per request.
//
// That is not a nicety. web/lib/referenceData.js#getVisibleTags ships the
// WHOLE catalog to every signed-in browser. A letter's text sitting in
// `description` would publish every letter in the game to everyone playing it.
//
// No Prisma import — both faces compose the same sentence.
