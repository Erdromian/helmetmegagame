// What is true about a place, and how to say it.
//
// A Location carries two kinds of fact, and the Examine button shows both
// without having to know which is which.
//
// AUTHORED attributes are written into docs/zones.yaml's per-location
// `attributes:` map and stored as JSON on Location.attributes. They are
// properties of the place itself and change only on a sync — "this room is
// the Depot" is not something that happens, it is something that is.
//
// DERIVED lines are read off live state and never authored: whether the ways
// out stand open, whether the machinery in here is running. The caller loads
// that state and hands it over as `ctx`, which is why this module can stay
// Prisma-free and network-free — the same reason db/lib/depot.js gives for
// living here. These are game facts, and both faces read them.
//
// Adding an attribute means adding one entry to ATTRIBUTES. The sync rejects
// a key that is not in it, so a typo in the YAML is a loud problem at sync
// time rather than a line that silently never prints.

// The two keys code matches on rather than merely prints. Exported so the web
// layer stops writing them as bare literals — a typo in one of those is a
// button that silently never appears, which is exactly the failure the sync's
// unknown-key check exists to prevent on the YAML side.
