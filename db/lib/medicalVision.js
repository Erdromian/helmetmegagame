// Who is qualified to treat what, and — because of that — who can SEE what.
//
// Two things live here that used to live only in web/lib/healRequests.js. The
// skill-tier walk moved down because the bot needs it too now: 🔍-inspecting
// someone shows you the ailments YOU could treat as routine, even the ones
// nobody else can see. A doctor prodding a belly knows appendicitis; the man
// standing next to them sees a person having a bad day.
//
// Same posture as inspectVision.js: no Prisma import, required by subpath from
// both bot/ and web/, so the rule can't drift between the two faces of the
// game. web/lib/healRequests.js re-exports the two ancestry helpers so its own
// callers keep importing from where they always did.

// Tag.parentTagId is the replacing tier chain (Medical (Basic) -> (Skilled) ->
// (Expert)). Holding a higher tier has to satisfy a requirement written
// against a lower one, or a surgeon would be unable to do a nurse's job.
//
// `tags` is the flat catalog as [{ id, parentTagId }]; the result maps a tag id
// to itself plus every ancestor above it. Cycle-guarded, since nothing in the
// schema stops a chain from looping back on itself.

// your FACE, so a hood or a Disguise Kit's false name has to take it off the
// read — otherwise the hooded stranger is an unknown young man whose tags
// name him. `identityVisible` is the caller's answer to "is this subject
