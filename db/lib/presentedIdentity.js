// Which name and face the room sees when a character speaks. Three cases, in
// order of precedence:
//
//   forced    — a held tag carries Tag.forcedName (Apex Form -> "Beast"). The
//               character posts under that name with the letter plaque for its
//               initial, never their own face, and cannot conceal.
//   concealed — something concealing is EQUIPPED and either forces it or the
//               character chose it: the vague alias from concealedIdentity.js
//               and that item's own plated sprite.
//   own       — Character.name and /api/avatar/<id>.
//
// Resolved at READ time from the live row plus the held tags, the same posture
// as the letter plaque and the Catatonic role suffix: nothing on the Character
// row is rewritten when the tag lands, so two Beasts never collide on
// Character.name and a GM table still shows who it is.
//
// `alias` is "the name the room saw when it was not the real one" — set for
// both the concealed and the forced case, and what recordArchiveMessage
// freezes into ArchiveEntry.concealedAlias so /archive renders
// `Beast (Jorren Vask)` the way it renders a hood. `concealed` stays true only
// for a real hood: the impoverished 🔍 embed and the no-relay rule in
// messageCreate.js are about hiding, and a Beast is not hiding.
//
// Concealment is DERIVED, not just stored. Character.concealed is only the
// player's wish; it takes effect solely while a Tag.concealsIdentity item is
// equipped, and a Tag.forcesConceal item overrides the column entirely. So a
// row left concealed after the mask came off resolves back to the real face on
// its own, and no backfill or catch-up pass is needed for either direction.
//
// presentedIdentity / forcedNameFrom / concealmentFrom / letterPlaqueFile are
// pure; loadForcedName and loadConcealment are the two queries, for call sites
// that already hold a Character without its tags. Spread into the @lifeweb/db
// barrel beside concealedIdentity.js.
