// auto-labor pass (db/lib/autoLaborPass.js) and the Labor? button
// (db/lib/locationAnchorRow.js's handler).
//
// Two general tiers and three location-scaled specialisations. A character
// holding several of them does not choose — resolveLaborRateFrom scores every
// candidate they qualify for and pays the best one, so "I forgot to switch to
// Fishing" is not a way to lose a day. See docs/systemdocs/LABORING.md.
//
// Same pure-rules / async-context split as db/lib/narrowcastAccess.js, and for
// a sharper reason here: the auto-labor pass resolves a Labor for every idle
// character in one bulk pass, so the rules have to be callable against a
// context the caller already has in hand rather than each one costing its own
// round trip.
