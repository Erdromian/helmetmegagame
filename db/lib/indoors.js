// Parking a cart or a mount at the door (docs/systemdocs/CARRY.md §3).
//
// A Location marked `indoors: true` in docs/zones.yaml is a place you walk
// INTO — the Cathedral, the Sanctuary, the Inn, the Keep, the Undercroft, the
// Factory. You cannot bring a horse into a chapel, so arriving unequips
// anything stowable and says so. The carry bonus goes with it, which is the
// whole point: the cap shrinks, and the character is very likely Overburdened
// until they walk back out and take the reins again.
//
// Nothing is ever DROPPED for this. settleCarry's overflow is
// acquisition-driven, so losing capacity at a door makes someone Overburdened
// and no more — walking into an inn must never dump a cart's contents onto the
// floor of it.
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter and stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel, the same
// posture as carry.js, because locationMove.js requires it.

// Unequips every stowable this character has out, if they are standing
// somewhere indoors. Returns the display names parked, so the caller can DM
// them — this module does no Discord work of its own.
