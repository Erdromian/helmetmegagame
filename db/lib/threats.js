// The threat catalog: every antagonist seat in the game, in one place.
//
// A threat is three things at once, and which ones an entry carries is what
// tells them apart:
//
//   optIn      a checkbox on the creation wizard's Antagonists step. Consent
//              data — a player says which seats they are open to being handed.
//   assign     a real seat a GM can hand to an existing character. Grants the
//              tags and points named here and DMs the blurb.
//   spawn      the same seat, handed to somebody with no character: a whole
//              new one, offered over DM and accepted with a button.
//
// MOST OPT-INS ARE DECOYS. They carry `optIn` and nothing else, so ticking one
// tells a GM about consent without telling the player which seats are real.
// An entry with neither `assign` nor `optIn` is a brief a GM runs entirely by
// hand — no checkbox, no button, prose only.
//
// Kept in code rather than a table for the same reason as db/lib/roleIds.js:
// fixed values that can never differ per environment, so a row would only add
// a join and a way to drift.
//
// Alphabetized by `name` so catalog order *is* display order and nothing
// downstream has to sort. That ordering is also what hides the real seats
// among the decoys on the wizard.
//
// The blurbs are Bascinet's own words and carry no ‡ (CLAUDE.md), except the
// one Demoness line that was drafted here and still waits on a rewrite.
