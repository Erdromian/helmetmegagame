//
// Every target states its own privacy in full — nothing is inherited from
// the category, because Discord's category "sync" is a one-time copy at
// creation that drifts independently afterwards.
//
// The @everyone VIEW_CHANNEL deny is the entire mechanism that makes a
// channel private; every other overwrite here is an allow layered on top of
// it. Since Bascinet 2 a zone carries only its category and #summary (opened
// by the "Zone: X" role); every Location has its own text channel, and its
// Rooms are threads under it that the bot alone may create.
//
// A Location channel is opened by a PER-MEMBER overwrite, not by a
// "Location: X" role. 56 locations would have cost 56 of the guild's 250
// roles, on top of one personal role per living character; Discord allows
// 1000 overwrites per channel instead, which this game cannot reach.
// LOCATION_MEMBER_ALLOW below is the bit set that used to sit on the role,
// now handed to one member at a time by applyLocationMoveSideEffects.
