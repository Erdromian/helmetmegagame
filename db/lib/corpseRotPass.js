// A person's corpse goes off. docs/systemdocs/CORPSES.md.
//
// Three turns after they died, "Ada's Corpse" becomes "Ada's Rotten Corpse"
// and starts stinking (bot/src/lib/deathSmell.js). Monster corpses never rot:
// a Nekker left lying around stays butcherable, and only a person smells.
//
// THIS RENAMES THE TAG ROW IN PLACE rather than expiring into a second one,
// which is the whole trick and worth explaining, because Tag.expiresInto is
// right there and looks like the answer:
//
//   * expiresInto names catalog SLUGS, and "Ada's Rotten Corpse" is written
//     per-character and never appears in docs/tags.yaml. There is no slug for
//     it to name.
//   * tagExpiryPass.js only walks CharacterTag, and a corpse is almost always
//     a RoomTag lying on a floor.
//   * a chain would leave the holding pointing at the OLD row, so a corpse
//     someone was carrying would rot into a tag in a different place.
//
// Renaming sidesteps all three: one row, one identity, and a body in your bag
// rots in your bag.
//
// IT MUST RUN BEFORE THE "expirySweep" PASS. That sweep is a blind deleteMany
// over `expiresTurn <= turn.number`, so a corpse that reached its clock would
// simply be deleted. Nulling expiresTurn here is what takes it out of the
// sweep's reach — no exemption list, no special case in db/index.js.
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter — see db/lib/dm.js for why.
