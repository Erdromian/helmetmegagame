// a client component can import it through web/lib/characterName.js without
// dragging PrismaClient into the browser bundle. Same posture as
// db/lib/roleColor.js and db/lib/gambitModifier.js, and spread into the @lifeweb/db
// barrel alongside them.
//
// The word list itself lives in db/lib/titles.js, along with what earns each
// one. Nothing here decides who may be a Baron.

// and looks it up by the webhook username — so cap the *inputs* instead and
// let the composed name be short by construction:
//
//   10 + 1 + 24 + 1 + (20 + 2 quotes) + 1 + 20 = 79

// offering it), so re-normalizing on, say, a dynasty rename would silently
// strip a disgraced knight's "Sir". See web/lib/dynasty.js, which composes
// through formatCharacterName and never comes through here.
// `gender` is not optional in practice: it selects which form of a title the

// NEUTRAL list ("Noble") rejects it and quietly files him untitled. Both
