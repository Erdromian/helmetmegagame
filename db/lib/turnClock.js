// DAWN/DUSK, so the end is derivable — every turn opens at midnight and closes
// at the next midnight (and this module does not even need to know the phase:
// the next boundary is the next boundary). Turns were 12 hours once, with a
// second boundary at noon; the phases still alternate, so an in-game day is
// now two real days. The old helper
// (weather.js#turnEndEpochSeconds) derived it from *now* and the phase, which
// is only correct at the instant the turn opens: the bot rebuilds the #turns
// announcement on restart, so a restart at 18:00 posted "ends at noon, six
// hours ago". Everything here derives it from `turn.startedAt` instead, which
// is also what makes a manually advanced turn come out right.
//
// Pure: no Prisma, no discord.js. Takes a Turn row (only `phase` and
// `startedAt` are read) and returns Dates.
