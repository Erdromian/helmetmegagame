// {tag:damaged-vision} is the only stackable tag in the catalog whose COUNT
// means something. Nothing else in the engine reads a quantity as a threshold:
// expiresInto (db/lib/tagExpiryPass.js) fires off a clock and knows nothing
// about stacks, and the stackable sweep in db/index.js sheds one unit at a
// time. So counting is a pass of its own, which is also the honest shape —
// this is a slow accumulation somebody chose five times, not something that
// happened to them on a timer.
//
// The whole stack comes off when it fires. Blind is terminal enough that
// leaving four notches behind would only ask "damaged toward what?"
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter — see db/lib/dm.js for why.
