// Two-stage draw on a roll of 6: pick a tier by the standing zone's column
// below, then pick uniformly among that tier's slugs. Slugs are validated
// against the live Tag catalog by validateCavingLoot() — call that once at
// startup (bot/src/index.js and web's instrumentation hook), not per-roll,
// so a typo fails loud instead of handing a player nothing on the one 6
// they rolled all week.
