// Seat math for a Role, shared by the character-creation picker, the
// createCharacter server action's race check, and the GM panel — so all
// three agree on what "full" means.
//
// The three shapes come straight from docs/roles.yaml's multiple/weight
// pair (see Role in schema.prisma):
//   isUnique  -> exactly 1 seat, at any game size. A single named character
//                (Baron, Bishop, Headman) — NOT the same as "1 per 100".
//   unlimited -> uncapped chaff roles (Commoner, Migrant).
//   weight    -> seats per 100 players, scaled by GameConfig.playerCount.
//
// Returns Infinity for uncapped roles so callers can compare `taken < cap`
// without special-casing. A weighted role never rounds below 1 — a role
// listed in the YAML should always be pickable by somebody, even at a small
// player count where round() would otherwise floor it to zero.

// Seats that never reopen. A seat is normally held only by a LIVING character
// — the holder dies and the picker offers the role again, which is right for
// a Bum or a Cerberus. These roles are the exception: once someone has held
// the seat it stays taken for the rest of the run, dead holder or not, so
// there is never a second Baron, a second Sheriff. That includes the roles
// with a single seat at 100 players (Diplomat, Sheriff) — Gunboat confirmed
// they are one-and-done.
//
// A slug list rather than a roles.yaml key + Role column (CHARACTERS.md "Seat
// caps"): a static rule over a fixed roster, and a column would mean a live
// migration for a boolean. The caveat that comes with that: it is keyed on
// Role.slug, so renaming a slug in the YAML silently drops the role from this
// list.
