// What a place is worth to labor in, and how that changes.
//
// Every Location carries at most three LocationYield rows, one per LaborKind.
// `base` is what docs/zones.yaml authored; `current` is where the world has
// drifted it to, and `current` is the only number a payout or the Labor?
// button ever reads. No row for a (location, kind) pair means that labor is
// impossible there — the button prints a bare × and the resolver skips it.
//
// The model is a mean-reverting random walk with occasional jump events, in
// the same spirit as a Markov chain: most days nothing much
// happens, and rarely something does and then wears off. Per turn, per row:
//
//   target  = in an event ? eventTarget : base
//   current = clamp(current + reversion * (target - current) + noise, 0, CAP)
//
// An event does not move `current` itself — it moves what `current` is being
// pulled toward. That is what makes a swing arrive over a couple of turns
// rather than as a step change, and what makes it decay on its own once the
// window closes: clearing eventTarget puts `base` back in the target slot and
// the same reversion term walks it home. There is no separate recovery path.
//
// See docs/systemdocs/LABORING.md.

// Nothing is ever worth more than double an ordinary spot, or less than
// nothing. Both ends are reachable but rare — the walk has to be pushed there
// by an event and held, and the reversion is always pulling it back.

const YIELD_FLOOR = 0;

// Per-kind volatility. `reversion` is how hard a row is pulled toward its
// target each turn (higher = snaps back faster); `sigma` is the standard
// deviation of the daily wobble on top of that. The steady-state spread of the
// walk is roughly sigma / sqrt(2 * reversion), which is the number that
// actually shows up in play:
//
//   HUNTING  0.12 / sqrt(0.60) ~ +/-0.16   game is thick with it
//   FISHING  0.07 / sqrt(0.40) ~ +/-0.11   the river is the river, mostly
//   FARMING  0.025 / sqrt(0.24) ~ +/-0.05  a field is a field
//
// `eventChance` is per row per turn, except FARMING's, which is rolled ONCE
// for the whole world (see rollEvents) — a blight takes every field at once,
// and rolling it per-location would fire a dozen times in a month instead of
// about once.
