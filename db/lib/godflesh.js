// Cutting Godflesh out of the marsh: the die, the yield, and the hand you

//
// Modelled on db/lib/depotTurret.js, and deliberately so — the two are the
// same shape of problem (a thing that hurts you, with armour deciding HOW
// badly rather than WHETHER). What is different is the entry: the turret rolls
// its table every time, and this one only reaches the table on a 1. Extracting
// is meant to be routine work that occasionally takes a finger, not a coin
// flip with your body.
//
// The pattern it was copied from has since moved on. The turret no longer picks
// a column off a hardcoded slug list — armour is a number on the tag
// (Tag.ballisticArmor, db/lib/armorValue.js) bending one curve. This file kept
// its two-column table on purpose: the only thing between a chainsaw and your
// hand is a specific pair of gloves, so "gloves or no gloves" is the honest
// model here and a general armour value would be pretending otherwise. If a
// third kind of hand protection ever exists, that stops being true.
//
// Pure and Prisma-free, like the turret: the caller loads the tags and writes
// the result, and this decides only what happens. See
// docs/systemdocs/FACTORY.md.
