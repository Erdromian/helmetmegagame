// Whether a character can read a piece of writing right now.

// Two halves, and they answer to different things. Letters are a SKILL — the
// `literate` tag, bought or taught. Eyes are a CONDITION — blind, blind drunk,
// nearsighted with your spectacles in a sack, or sun-sensitive standing
// outdoors at Dawn. Both have to be true, and db/lib/examineVision.js already
// owns the whole second half, so this file is mostly a composition.
//
// ONE MESSAGE FOR EVERY CAUSE. A blind man and an illiterate one see exactly
// the same line, because the alternative leaks a condition: a tag chip that
// said "your eyes are too bad for this" would tell anyone looking over your
// shoulder something they had no business learning. It also matters that the
// line is the same on a noticeboard, in a DM and on the sheet — a written
// thing you cannot read should look the same everywhere in the game.
//
// No Prisma import, same posture as examineVision.js and inspectVision.js
// beside it: the sheet wants the answer to compose a chip, the server action
// wants it to refuse, and neither should be able to drift from the other.
