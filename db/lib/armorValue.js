// Armour, as the game shows it and as the guns roll against it.
//
// Two numbers live on every piece of gear (Tag.meleeArmor, Tag.ballisticArmor,
// both 0.0-1.0). This file owns the three things that must not drift apart:
// the word a number is shown as, how several worn pieces combine, and nothing
// else. The severity ladder and the odds stay in db/lib/depotTurret.js — that
// file is the ballistics, this one is the armour.
//
// It replaced a hardcoded priority list of seven body-armour slugs. That list
// knew about plate and mail and did not know about a single helmet, shield,
// buckler, pavise or the spacesuit, so a character in a closed steel helm rolled
// on the bare no-armour column. A number on the tag cannot go stale the way a
// list in a file did the moment somebody added a helmet to the catalog.
//
// Pure and Prisma-free, so both faces and the sync can use it.

// Words, never numbers — the same posture db/lib/laborYield.js#qualityWord
// takes for Laboring. A player is told a helmet is Sufficient against bullets;
// working out that Sufficient is 0.35 and Good is 0.5 is their job, and it
// keeps kit choice a judgement rather than a spreadsheet.
//
// Six steps over 0..1, evenly cut. "None" covers absent as well as zero: a
// skill has no armour value and neither does a sack over the head, and there is
// no useful difference between those two for a player reading a chip.

// a full kit a real reward while making the second and third piece each worth
// less than the first, which is both how armour actually works and what stops
