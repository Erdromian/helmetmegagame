// "Here": the one co-presence rule both faces of the game judge by.
//
// A character can act on someone standing at the same Location who hasn't
// hidden their face — and, for the actions that work on a body, on an
// unburied corpse. Location-grain since Bascinet 2; a concealed character is
// off every picker and every gate because /conceal is the game's "you don't
// know who this is", and naming them would undo it. A corpse can't hold a
// hood up, so the dead show when `allowDead` asks for them.
//
// web/lib/peopleHere.js binds these to prisma for the web app; the bot's
// offer handlers (bot/src/lib/offers.js) and db/lib/lessons.js call them
// directly. No Prisma import here on purpose — same posture as
// inspectVision.js.
