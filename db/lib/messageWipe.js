// The message wipe: called from db/index.js#advanceTurn() on EVERY turn while
// GameConfig.messageWipeEnabled is on.
//
// TWO CADENCES, and the split is the whole point of this file. A turn is one
// real day, but Dawn and Dusk alternate, so anything gated on Dawn only comes
// round every 48 hours. Roleplay should not outlive the day it happened in:
//
//   every turn  — a Location channel down to its pinned anchor, every Room
//                 thread down to its starter, every Conversation deleted
//                 outright (there is no persistence any more), and every
//                 special channel the registry marks `wipe: "clear"`.
//   Dawn only   — a zone's #summary. It is the abstracted, slowmoded channel
//                 the adjudication results land in, so it is allowed the
//                 longer life the rest no longer gets.
//
// Every rule is bounded by a CUTOFF (the moment the turn advance's side
// effects began), so it can't eat its own push's #summary post or a message
// sent while the wipe is still walking there. Sequential, not Promise.all, to
// respect Discord's rate limits.
