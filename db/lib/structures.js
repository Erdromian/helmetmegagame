// Structures: the shared read half of the building system.
//
// A Structure row is a built thing standing at a Location — and, while
// UNDER_CONSTRUCTION, the build site itself (schema.prisma has the full
// model notes). This module owns the reads and the wording both faces
// share: the loader that joins a row to its catalog type, the derived
// can-you-build-here rule, and the ambient lines a site speaks into its
// Location channel. The WRITES live in the web server actions
// (web/app/(app)/character/requestActions.js) — the web face is the only
// builder, the same way it is the only crafter.
//
// Structure types live in the assets-structures TagGroup
// (docs/taggroups.yaml) — display color and catalog organisation only. The
// runtime rules never key on the group: unique is per-type
// (placement.unique), non-stacking is per labor kind
// (laborAccess.js#structureTools).
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter and stays off the @lifeweb/db barrel, the
// db/lib/dm.js convention; require it by path.
