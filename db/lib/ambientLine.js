// The house format for a line the WORLD says into a channel — a gate crossing
// into a zone's #summary, a smell in a Location, a whisper overheard in a
// Room, somebody moving goods around a stash, the intercom.
//
// It is Discord's `-#` subtext, and the reason is that these lines are
// scenery. They arrive unprompted, often while people are mid-scene, and
// full-size bot text competing with player prose is what made them read as
// interruptions. Subtext sits under the conversation instead of in it.
//
// Before this existed the five call sites had four different formats between
// them — `»`, `*italics*`, bare text, and one that had lost its ‡ entirely.
// Anything new that narrates into a channel comes through here.
//
// Two mechanical rules, both easy to get wrong by hand:
//   - `-#` is PER LINE. A multi-line block needs the prefix on every line, or
//     everything after the first renders full size.
//   - One ‡ per message, at the very end — not one per line (CLAUDE.md).

// `text` is the line itself; `lines` are quoted extras under it, which take a
// `»` inside the subtext the way any restated content does.
// `signed: false` is for a line Bascinet wrote verbatim. The ‡ marks copy
// Claude drafted and nobody has signed off yet (CLAUDE.md), so appending one
// to Bascinet's own words says the opposite of what it means. Everything else
// gets the mark, which is why it is the default — a caller has to opt out on
// purpose, and only for a line it can point at in a brief.
function ambientLine(text, lines = [], { signed = true } = {}) {
  // `text` is SPLIT on newlines rather than assumed single-line: a two-line
  // string would otherwise render its second half at full size — the exact
  // mistake the header warns about, made by the helper that prevents it.
  const body = [
    ...String(text).split("\n").map((l) => `-# ${l}`),
    ...lines.map((l) => `-# » ${l}`),
  ];
  // The mark is no longer appended (copy pass, 2026-09-07). `signed` is
  // still accepted so callers need not change; it does nothing now.
  void signed;
  return body.join("\n");
