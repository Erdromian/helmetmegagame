// re-posting it into a single #archive channel — hundreds of sequential posts
// down one ~1 msg/sec lane, the most expensive thing the bot did, and it grew
// with player count. It also had to guess at two fields it can now be told
// outright: the character (matched by *current* name, so a rename
// mis-attributed everything they had ever said) and the turn (inferred by
// comparing timestamps against Turn.gameDate).
//
// Takes `prisma` as a parameter rather than require("../index"), same reason
// as dm.js and turnAnnouncement.js: db/index.js imports this module, so
// requiring it back would resolve to a partial (prisma-less) exports object.
// Deliberately NOT spread into the @lifeweb/db barrel — require it by path.

// row is never worth breaking a player's message over, and the proxy path
// calls this inline with the send. Failures are logged, not thrown.
