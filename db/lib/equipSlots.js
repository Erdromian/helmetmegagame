// Which equipped things cannot be worn together.
//
// GameConfig.equipSlots is a flat COUNT — six things, whatever they are — and
// it was the only limit for a long time, which meant a character could equip
// three helmets and two shields as long as they had the slots free. This adds
// the other half: Tag.equipSlot says where a thing sits, and Tag.equipLayer 1-4
// says how deep, so a mail coif (1) goes under a knight's helm (3) and two
// helms do not go together at all.
//
// SHIELD carries no layer, because there is only ever one shield.
//
// Two independent code paths flip CharacterTag.equipped — the player's own
// toggle (web/app/(app)/character/equipActions.js) and the GM/staged batch
// (db/lib/tagOps.js) — so the rule lives here rather than in either of them. It
// is written as "look at the whole equipped set and find a clash" rather than
// "may I add this one?", because the batch path applies its writes first and
// then checks, and a two-argument form could not express "unequip A, equip B"
// without rejecting B for a conflict with an A that is already gone.
//
// See docs/systemdocs/TAGS.md.
