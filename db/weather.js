// Weather rolls every turn (once a day — see advanceTurn() in
// db/index.js), as a Markov transition off the *previous turn's* weather,
// split into a DAWN table and a DUSK table so the roll also depends on
// which phase is being entered. Every row in both tables sums to 100.
//
// The self-transition (diagonal) weight is what creates a streak: CLEAR
// and RAIN are "spell" states that can run several turns in a row (a clear
// spell; three turns of rain). STORM's diagonal is deliberately the
// highest of any state in either table — every *other* state only enters
// STORM rarely (kept low on purpose, so it stays a dramatic, occasional
// event rather than the norm), but once one kicks off it can rage for many
// turns straight, the same in the morning as the evening — so a full
// multi-day storm is rare but genuinely possible, not diluted away by
// starting over each turn.
//
// FOG is the one state that's genuinely phase-dependent, mirroring real
// mornings-fog-burns-off-by-evening behavior: the DAWN table both enters
// and holds FOG far more readily (from every other state, and with a much
// higher self-transition) than the DUSK table, where FOG mostly resolves
// back to CLEAR instead of persisting.
