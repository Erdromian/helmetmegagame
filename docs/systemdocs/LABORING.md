# Laboring

How a character turns a day into ⬢. Replaces the old flat Labor checkbox: it
is now a kind of Move, it needs a skill, and **where you stand decides what
it pays**.

Read this before touching `db/lib/laborAccess.js`, `db/lib/production.js`,
`db/lib/laborYield.js`, `db/lib/autoLaborPass.js`, the `yield:` blocks in
`docs/zones.yaml`, or any `laborBonus:` in `docs/tags.yaml`.

## 1. The shape of it

Three things changed at once, and they only make sense together:

- **There is no Default Move.** `DefaultEffort` is gone. If you file nothing,
  you labor — automatically, if you can.
- **Labor is a third `MoveKind`**, alongside `ROUTINE` and `GAMBIT`. A turn
  buys one of the three, so filing a Routine or a Gambit *costs* you the day's
  labor. There is no checkbox any more.
- **Laboring is a skill, not a floor.** Hold no Laboring tag and you cannot
  labor at all. The old `base` tier is deleted.

## 2. The tag ladder

All five cost **7** (`TAGS.md` §4a: significant — it reliably changes how a
month goes). Ranges live in `PRODUCTION_RATES` in `db/lib/production.js`,
which is the single source for both the payout and the `{resource:labor:tier}`
bubbles the tag descriptions render through.

| slug | name | range | gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `laboring-basic` | Laboring (Basic) | 0–2 | — |
| `laboring-skilled` | Laboring (Skilled) | 1–4 | `parentTag: laboring-basic` |
| `laboring-hunting` | Laboring (Hunting) | 0–18 | `requiredTag: laboring-skilled` |
| `laboring-farming` | Laboring (Farming) | 12–16 | `requiredTag: laboring-skilled` |
| `laboring-fishing` | Laboring (Fishing) | 7–14 | `requiredTag: laboring-skilled` |

The slugs were `laborer-*` before this rework and are `laboring-*` now, because
`db/lib/syncTags.js` enforces that **a slug is always its name, slugified** — so
anyone reading a slug in code or in a Desire's `requires` knows which tag it is.
Renaming the display name without the slug is a sync error, not a warning. The
old rows are cleared by `db:prune-tags -- --apply`.

The bottom two are general: they pay the same everywhere. The top three are
**side-grades, not rungs**. Holding several is fine and normal, and there is
nothing to switch between — §4 pays the best one you qualify for.

**Basic ignores `GameConfig.productionCoefficient`** (`UNSCALED_TIERS` in
`production.js`). It is the floor of the whole economy, and a GM turning the
dial down to rebalance specialists must not quietly delete subsistence too.
Everything else scales.

The dial ships at **0.93** rather than 1 — laboring was cut about 7% before
launch. Two things that buys less than it looks like: Basic is exempt as above,
and Skilled's 1–4 rounds straight back to 1–4, so a small move on the dial
reaches only the three specialisations. At 0.93 and a location coefficient of
1.0 those become Hunting 0–17, Farming 11–15, Fishing 7–13. Moving the general
tiers at all means editing `PRODUCTION_RATES`, where one whole point is 25%.

## 3. What a place is worth

Each Location carries up to three `LocationYield` rows, one per `LaborKind`.
**No row means that labor is impossible there** — that is what prints `×`, and
it is why no Location needs a "wilderness" or "water" flag anywhere in the
schema. The row is the gate.

`base` is authored in `docs/zones.yaml`; `current` is where the world has
drifted it, and `current` is the only number a payout or the Examine button
ever reads.

```yaml
    forest-boardwalk:
      name: Boardwalk
      description: >-
        …
      yield: { hunting: 0.7, farming: 0.3 }
```

`db:sync-zones` writes these. It always writes `base`. It does **not** write
`current` — that is live state, and a routine re-sync must not shove the whole
map back to its authored value mid-game. The exception is a `base` that
actually changed, which is Bascinet retuning the map: the row is reset and any
running event cleared, so the edit lands on the next turn rather than creeping
in over a week. A kind dropped from the YAML has its row deleted.

`collectYields` in `db/lib/syncZones.js` refuses a typo'd kind, a value outside
0–2, and an explicit `0` (omit the key instead) — a silent `hunitng: 0.5`
would disable hunting somewhere and the symptom is nearly invisible in play.

### 3a. The authored table

Anything not listed has no row and cannot be worked. Locations are addressed by
slug — open country carries its zone as a prefix, built places do not
(`docs/zones.yaml`).

**Farming** — Farms 1.0 · Manors 0.6 · `forest-north-road` / `forest-shrine` /
`forest-terraces` 0.5 · every other Forest place 0.3 · Keep 0.2.

**Fishing** — `forest-river` / `forest-crossroads` / `forest-north-road` /
`forest-charcoal` / `forest-culvert` / `forest-coppice` 0.7 ·
`hills-black-pines` 0.8 · the five open Marshes 1.0.

**Hunting** — Forest 0.5 except `forest-boardwalk` 0.7 · the five open Marshes
1.0 · Black Hills 1.0 except `hills-scrub` 1.1 and `hills-black-pines` 1.3 ·
the four Caves 0.4 · Depths 0.6 except `depths-runnel` 1.8 and `depths-saltrise`
1.6.

The marsh Village fishes at 1.2 and does nothing else; the Godard Factory has
no rows at all and is worked anyway (§3b). Town and Fortress have neither
hunting nor fishing; their only yield is farming. Nothing farms or fishes
underground.

**The old blanket "nothing can be produced in the depths" is gone.** Hunting
down there is now most of the reason to go.

### 3b. The one place with no rows that can still be worked

A Location carrying the `refinery: true` attribute is worked with **no
`LocationYield` row at all**, and pays in goods rather than ⬢: one Godflesh
becomes eight Squeeze on the Godard Factory floor. `resolveLaborRateFrom`
short-circuits before the candidate loop below and returns `tier: "refining"`
with a real `0-0` expression — real, because `rollResourceRange` pays nothing
on a failed parse and does so silently.

It is the only exception to "the row IS the gate", and it is a second gate
beside the rows rather than a hole in them: everything without the attribute
still needs its row. It still wants a Laboring tag, and it still grants
Exhausted. See `FACTORY.md` §4.

## 4. Resolving one labor

`resolveLaborRateFrom` in `db/lib/laborAccess.js`, in order:

1. **Gate.** Holding `exhausted` refuses. That is the whole gate now — one
   labor per day, granted by the payout itself (`db/lib/moveEffects.js`) and
   read back until the expiry sweep clears it a turn later.
2. **Build candidates.** The best general tier held (Skilled, else Basic), plus
   one per specialisation held that has a `LocationYield` row here. No general
   tier at all means no candidates and no labor.
3. **Scale.** `productionCoefficient` × the location's `current`, both ends,
   rounded. Basic skips both.
4. **Add tools** for that candidate's kind (§5). Only the best weapon counts;
   everything else sums.
5. **Pick the winner** — highest ceiling, tie-broken on the better floor.
6. **Soft Hands** halves both ends, floor. It lands *after* the tools, so it is
   literally "half of what you make".
7. **Lifeweb failure** (§6).

The returned `expression` is a **machine format** — `"min-max"`, matched by
`db/lib/resourceDelta.js#rollResourceRange` against `/^(\d+)-(\d+)$/`. Never
append anything to it. A failed parse pays the character nothing, silently.
The tool breakdown rides out as separate fields so the DM can name it in a
`-#` subtext line instead.

Picking the best automatically is the point: "I forgot to switch to Fishing" is
not a way to lose a day, and a specialisation that doesn't beat your general
tier never costs you anything.

## 5. Tools

Authored as a `laborBonus:` block on a tag, normalised and validated by
`db/lib/tagShapes.js`, stored as `Tag.laborBonus`:

```yaml
    laborBonus: { kind: hunting, amount: 3, equipped: true, requiresTag: horse }
```

`equipped` defaults **true**. The sync refuses a bonus that requires being
equipped on a tag that isn't `equippable`, and a `requiresTag` naming a tag
that doesn't exist.

| tag | kind | ⬢ | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sling | hunting | +1 | equipped |
| Shortbow | hunting | +2 | equipped |
| Longbow | hunting | +3 | equipped |
| Crossbow | hunting | +3 | equipped |
| Trapping Gear | hunting | +3 | equipped; new, craftable and depot stock |
| Butcher | hunting | +2 | **not** equipped — it's a skill |
| every firearm | hunting | +2 | equipped |
| Pitchfork | farming | +1 | equipped |
| Plow | farming | +4 | not equipped; needs a `horse` |
| Fishing Rod | fishing | +1 | equipped; new |

**Weapon bonuses do not stack with each other.** You hunt with one weapon in
your hands, so only the best-paying tag in the `items-weapons` group counts —
a Longbow and a Crossbow pay +3, not +6, and the second one is dead weight.
Everything outside that group sums on top of it, so a Longbow, Trapping Gear
and Butcher is +3 +3 +2 = **+8**. `GameConfig.equipSlots` still caps how much
of it you can carry at once.

The group is the whole test, which means a tag's `group:` is now load-bearing
for laboring: move a bow out of `items-weapons` and it silently starts
stacking. The Pitchfork sits in that group too — it pays into farming rather
than hunting, so it competes with no other weapon and the rule never bites it.

**Butcher's bonus narrowed.** It used to be a hardcoded flat +2 on every tier
but farming. It is hunting-only now, and it moved out of code into the YAML.

**A COMPLETE structure pays into labor too, as a synthetic tool nobody
carries.** A structure whose `placement.laborBonus` names a kind (the same
shape as a tag's `laborBonus:` block above) enters everyone standing at its
Location's labor — `db/lib/laborAccess.js#structureTools` — but it is never
equipped and never a weapon, so it sums on top of the best personal weapon
rather than competing with it. **Non-stacking per kind**: two hunting
structures on the same ground pay like the better of the two, not both added
together — a location-wide bonus is a faucet times occupancy, and the ceiling
has to be enforced here rather than hoped about in catalog pricing. `DAMAGED`,
`UNDER_CONSTRUCTION` and wrecked (`RUINED`/`ABANDONED`) structures pay
nothing — the same `COMPLETE`-only reading `db/lib/equipmentReach.js` uses for
Workshop Equipment (`SMITHING.md` §2a), so Damaging one is worth doing. The
payout DM names a paying structure through the same `formatLaborBonusNote`
path as any tool, so a player reads "Fish Weir +2" no differently from
"Fishing Rod +1".

## 6. When the Lifeweb fails

At or below `LIFEWEB_SPUTTER_THRESHOLD` (20, in `db/lib/lifeweb.js` — it moved
there from `db/index.js` so `db/lib/` modules can reach it):

- **Basic yields nothing at all.** Not scaled — stopped. 5% of "you can
  sometimes provide for yourself" is nothing with extra steps.
- Everything else keeps `Math.floor(x * 0.05)`.

In practice that zeroes almost the whole economy. Only the richest hunting in
the Depths still pays a single ⬢. That is the intent: this used to be flavor
text on a turn announcement and nothing else.

## 7. Drift — what the land does on its own

`db/lib/laborYield.js`. A mean-reverting random walk plus jump events, in the
same spirit as `db/weather.js`'s Markov table.

```
target  = in an event ? eventTarget : base
current = clamp(current + reversion * (target - current) + gaussian(sigma), 0, 2)
```

An event does **not** move `current` — it moves what `current` is pulled
toward. That is what makes a swing arrive over a couple of turns instead of as
a step change, and what makes it decay on its own: clearing `eventTarget` puts
`base` back in the target slot and the same reversion walks it home. There is
no separate recovery path.

| kind | reversion | sigma | daily wobble | event chance | length | magnitude |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HUNTING | 0.30 | 0.12 | ≈ ±0.16 | 6% per location per turn | 2–8 turns | ×0.25 – ×2 |
| FISHING | 0.20 | 0.07 | ≈ ±0.11 | 2.5% per location per turn | 3–10 turns | ×0.5 – ×1.6 |
| FARMING | 0.12 | 0.025 | ≈ ±0.05 | 1.8% per turn, **once for the world** | 8–20 turns | ×1.5 (40%) or ×0.55 (60%) |

Farming's event is rolled once globally and applied to every farming row at
once — a blight or a golden harvest, not one field having a bad week. Rolled
per-location it would fire about a dozen times a month across the 14 farming
locations instead of the roughly once that was asked for.

Measured over 200 simulated 60-turn games: hunting drifts ±0.16 from base with
2.8 events per location, fishing ±0.10 with 1.3, farming ±0.06 with 0.9.
Nothing ever left `[0, 2]`.

Clamped hard at both ends. A row with `base` 0 cannot exist, so nothing ever
drifts up from disabled.

### 7a. Where it runs

`TURN_PASSES` in `db/index.js`, as `"laborYield"`, late — **after**
`"autoLabor"** so a day is paid at the coefficients that were live during it,
and what it writes is what the next turn is worth.

It is random and therefore **not idempotent**, which is exactly why it is a
named pass: `markDone` is what stops a resumed turn advance from drifting the
whole map twice.

## 8. The auto-labor pass

`db/lib/autoLaborPass.js`, `TURN_PASSES` slot `"autoLabor"`, still **before**
Hunger so income lands before upkeep.

Candidate set is every ALIVE character, not a saved panel. It files nothing and
sends nothing for anyone who:

- already has an Action this turn (a travel stub counts — crossing zones spends
  the day),
- holds an `INCAPACITATING_SLUGS` tag,
- holds **no Laboring tag**,
- is Exhausted, or is standing where none of their skills reach.

Everyone else gets a `LABOR` Action, `CONFIRMED` / `PASSED`, `gmNotes:
"auto:labor"`, effects applied and snapshotted onto `appliedEffects` (which is
what tells the staged push to skip the row), and one DM naming the place, the
kind that won, the roll and any tool that paid.

The old summary-post machinery (`shareInSummary` / `summaryMessage`) died with
`DefaultEffort`. The pass returns `dms` only.

## 9. The Examine button

Fourth button on every Location anchor, between Secret rooms? and Converse
(`db/lib/locationAnchorRow.js`, prefix `loc:examine:`; handler `handleExamine`
in `bot/src/events/interactionCreate.js`). It was the **Labor?** button until
it grew the other two halves; the labor readout below is unchanged.

**Information only.** It files nothing, costs nothing, and anyone standing
there can press it whether or not they hold a Laboring tag — scouting is the
point, and a scout reporting back to a hunter is a conversation the game wants.

Three parts, each dropped when it has nothing to say: what can be worked here,
what the place *is*, and what the ways out are doing.

Every line reads the same way — **a one-word topic, a colon, and the shortest
true sentence**. The labor readout was already shaped like that, and the prose
under it used to be written in three or four different voices, so a player had
to parse each line before knowing whether it mattered. Now the topic is the
first thing on the line and the eye can skip what it does not need.

```
» *Customs.*
**Hunting**: × | **Farming**: × | **Fishing**: ×
**Indoors**: your cart or horse has to stay at the door. ‡
**Noticeboard**: you can pin paper here. ‡
**Generator**: 5 days of coal left. ‡
**Shuttle**: it's here. ‡
**Narrows**: the way stands open. ‡
```

The second part is `db/lib/locationAttributes.js` reading
`Location.attributes`, authored per location in `docs/zones.yaml`; the third
walks the modular `LocationLink` rows through `db/lib/locationGraph.js#linksFor`
rather than trusting the anchor's own buttons, since a GM can flip an edge
without anyone refreshing a message. Note the gate lines say what is TRUE,
while the buttons beside them say what a click DOES — one of them would have to
be wrong if they were worded alike. A gate's topic word is the place on the far
side, which is also how a player reads the button row above it.

Structures print here too, one line each, and their `examine:` string in
`docs/tags.yaml` is authored as the **fragment after the colon**, ‡-free — the
topic is the structure's own name, so an `examine:` that named it again would
say it twice, and the line picks up its mark on the way out.

Words, never numbers. Working out that Bountiful beats Ample is the player's
job, and the numbers move anyway.

| `current` | word |
|---|---|
| no row, or 0 | `×` |
| < 0.30 | Barren |
| < 0.60 | Scarce |
| < 0.90 | Modest |
| < 1.20 | Sufficient |
| < 1.55 | Ample |
| ≥ 1.55 | Bountiful |

At base, only `depths-runnel` and `depths-saltrise` wear Bountiful. This button is the
**only** surface that shows a coefficient — not `#summary`, not the anchor.
