# Adjudication

`/gm/turns` — the workspace where GMs arbitrate the turn. Rebuilt around one
rule after the first playtest broke the old flow:

> **Nothing a GM decides touches a player until the turn ends.**

A player locks in a Move; GMs spend the day *staging* — the canonical result,
private messages, public declarations, mechanical adjustments — all of it
freely editable until the turn-end cron (00:00 America/Chicago, nightly,
`TURN-ENGINE.md`) applies and delivers everything in one push. No more
resolve-a-move, DM-a-player, resolve-the-next drip: the whole turn lands at
once, for everyone.

## 1. The staged-arbitration model

Three kinds of staging, all held in real tables (not browser state — a GM's
day of work survives a refresh):

| What | Model | At the push |
|---|---|---|
| **Private messages** | `StagedMessage` (kind `PRIVATE`) + `StagedMessageRecipient` | One DM per recipient character's player, `»`-prefixed, logged to `DirectMessage` like every DM. |
| **Public declarations** | `StagedMessage` (kind `PUBLIC`, required `zoneId`) | Posted to **the row's own zone `#summary`**. The composer requires a real, standable zone (the `Caves` group seat is excluded from the picker), so a row always has one to post to. If that zone's summary channel isn't configured, the post is skipped and recorded on `deliveryFailures` — never lost. A post survives the Dawn wipe that runs later in the same push: the wipe only deletes what predates the push (`CHANNELS.md` §8). |
| **Mechanical adjustments** | `StagedEffect` — `payload` `{ resources?, tagPoints?, tagOps?, zoneId? }` per target character | Resources through `addResources`' clamp, tag ops through `db/lib/tagOps.js` — the same engine the Dev Panel applies with, so a staged `remove` leaves the tag's treated-wound aftermath behind (`Tag.removesInto`, `TAGS.md` §5c) and records it as `granted` on the snapshot. `tagPoints` is an unclamped increment (a GM may take points back, and negative is legal). `appliedEffect` snapshots what actually moved (the payload-vs-effect rule from `REQUESTS.md` §2). EffectComposer's `+ Add` row carries a quantity stepper, so a GM can stage several at once; asking for more than one of a non-stackable tag stages `force: true` right alongside it (`TAGS.md` §5a). |
| **Transfers** | `StagedEffect` — `payload` `{ transfer: { from, to, amount } }`, mutually exclusive with `resources` | A character-to-character ⬢ move, not a mint/burn from nowhere, via `db/lib/parties.js` and `db/lib/resourceTransfer.js#applyTransfer` (the same primitive a player's Transfer and every GM transfer surface use). Staged from the tray's own "+ Transfer" button (`TransferComposer.js`), separate from the multi-target Effect composer because a transfer is 1:1 by nature. |

### Long messages split; they are never truncated

Both kinds cap at **6000 characters** (`GM_MESSAGE_MAX_LENGTH`), which is about
three Discord messages, not one. Anything over Discord's own 2000-character
limit is split by `chunkMessage` (`db/lib/chunkText.js`) and sent as several
messages in order — DMs through `postDmBatched`, public declarations through
`postMessageBatched`. The split prefers blank lines, so paragraphs stay intact;
only a single paragraph that alone exceeds 2000 is cut mid-sentence. The `»`
prefix lands on the first chunk only, which is what the prefix rule means
anyway.

The composers show the count and refuse to stage over the cap, leaving a long
paste **visible and trimmable**. They deliberately carry no `maxLength`: that
attribute silently truncated a long paste at 1990 with no error and the Stage
button still enabled, so a GM could post two thirds of a declaration and never
find out. Anything that shows a character counter in this app should block
rather than cut, for the same reason.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **A multi-chunk declaration still survives the Dawn wipe.** The wipe's cutoff
  is the side-effect thunk's start time, and the public-post loop runs earlier
  in that same thunk, so every chunk postdates the cutoff.
- **Resend re-posts the whole body.** `postMessageBatched` and `postDmBatched`
  are sequential and throw on the first chunk that fails, so a failure partway
  leaves the earlier chunks delivered. Resending then duplicates them. This is
  rare by construction — a 429 is already retried, so the realistic failure is a
  channel that is gone or forbidden, which fails on chunk 1 and leaves nothing
  partial. It is not worth per-chunk bookkeeping; just delete the duplicate.

A staged message takes a *set* of recipients — you need to tell different
people different things, so a Move carries as many messages as the truth
requires, and a message needn't belong to any Move at all (the tray's
composers). A mass-apply ("Explosion Burns onto these four") writes one
`StagedEffect` per target under a shared `batchId`, so the tray shows and
deletes it as one line. Editing a batched row detaches it from its batch.

Rows freeze only when the push stamps them (`sentAt` / `appliedAt`). Until
then any GM may edit or delete any staging — concurrent GMs *append*
independent rows and merge harmlessly; edits to the same row are
last-write-wins, which five GMs can live with.

**Move links detach, never cascade.** `moveId` is `SetNull` on both staged
models: rejecting a Move (deleting its Action) leaves the staged work in the
tray as "unattached" for the GM to keep or drop.

## 2. What a Move is now

- **Submit = locked.** The Move modal is one shot ("Lock In Your Move");
  there is no draft window and no player edit. The GM-side escape hatch is
  **Reject**: deletes the Action, frees the turn, DMs the player "Your Move
  was returned to you — you can act again this turn." plus the reason,
  immediately — the one thing the desk sends in real time, because a freed
  turn the player doesn't know about is a wasted day. (The stored
  `source: "move_unlock"` / `actionType: "move_rejected"` values predate the
  rename and are kept — renaming them would orphan old audit rows and DM
  log entries.)
- **Declared numbers always pay.** Every confirmed Move's own
  `resourceDelta` (now only ever machine-written — the Labor roll; players
  can no longer type a delta at all) applies at the push, solved or not. A GM
  who disagrees stages a counter-effect; the composer's "offset declared"
  prefill is that in one click. Nothing pays at confirm any more — Routines
  and Labor included.
- **Solve is bookkeeping.** It stores the Result and Kind edit, stamps
  `reviewedBy`, and marks the staging complete. It applies nothing;
  Unsolve reverts nothing, because there is nothing yet to revert.
- **Silent close.** A Move still `OPEN` at the push closes `PASSED` with
  `auto:silent_close` appended to `gmNotes` and pays its declared numbers.
- **Every Routine gets a close DM**, whatever its review status, built to
  match the auto-labor DM: the description, `**Applied:** …`, and the
  resource roll. This is the *only* place a hand-filed Routine's payout is
  reported — nothing pays at confirm — so a player who declared used to learn
  less about their turn than one who slept through it. A **tail** ("passed
  without any special adjudication notes…") is appended only when nothing else
  spoke for the Move; a private staged message that actually went to *that*
  player, or a staged effect targeting them, drops the tail and keeps the
  summary. The one skip is `gmNotes` carrying any `auto:` marker — a default
  move and a travel stub send their own DM, and this would double it. Gambits
  are excluded here and get their die reveal instead.
  See `TURN-ENGINE.md` for where in the push it fires.
- **A Gambit's die is revealed by the push, and only by the push.** The d6 is
  rolled and stored at submit so the desk has it immediately, but the player
  reads it in one DM at the turn close (`formatGambitRollDm`,
  `db/lib/stagedPush.js`) — landing beside the staged private messages that
  say what it actually did. Nothing else shows a player their own roll: not
  the confirm DM, not `/character`. Every confirmed Gambit gets the DM
  regardless of what else the push sent them.
- **The Result box is canon.** One GM-facing field (`resultMessage`) holding
  what actually happened. `gmNotes` survives as a column for the `auto:*`
  machine markers only and renders nowhere.

## 3. The workspace

A full-viewport workspace: `web/app/(desk)/gm/turns/`, in the `(desk)` route
group with no PageShell and no centred max-width (the sanctioned deviation —
tokens and the shared control classes still apply; the `.desk-*` family in
`globals.css` is its layout). It **does** carry the nav rail, which is how you
leave; `/gm/players` is its sibling in the same group.

The route is `/gm/turns/[[...selection]]`, and the URL carries which row is
open — `/gm/turns/move/<id>`, `/gm/turns/caving/<id>`,
`/gm/turns/history/<id>`.
An optional catch-all, not `[moveId]`: the desk selects one of four things, so
the URL has to carry both halves of `{ type, id }`. Selection changes never
touch the server — `setSelected` is `useState` and the URL is mirrored with
`history.replaceState`, so picking a row leaves the queue, every DTO, the
inspector cache and the tray untouched.

Two consequences worth knowing. The route file has to genuinely exist, because
the desk polls `router.refresh()` against the *current* URL and a GM parked on
a selection would otherwise 404 on the first poll. And a revalidation of this
page must be `revalidatePath(TURNS_PATH, "page")` (`web/lib/routes.js`) — a
dynamic route needs its pattern, not a path that happens to match it. Only
the **cross-page** actions carry that call now (depot, store, dev panel,
player desk…); the desk's own actions dropped theirs, because every desk
call site follows success with `refresh()` and the pair meant rendering
`page.js` twice per mutation (see the header note in `actions.js`).

```

```

- **Queue rail** — the open turn's Moves and Caving rolls, as
  selectable rows. **Shows only the zones the GM chose to see**
  (`GAMEMASTERS.md` §1) — a hard gate now, not the soft opening default the
  zone seat used to be, and a search does not lift it. The rail's own Zone
  dropdown narrows within that. The **Zones** control that sets it is at the
  bottom of the inspector, on the right. A live lock renders as a small `GmAvatar`
  chip beside the row's real status pill — **never as a status of its own**.
  It used to be: a Move under a live lock displayed "In Progress" regardless
  of its actual `moveReviewStatus`, which let a GM's OWN lock on a Move they
  had just Solved make the desk they were sitting in read back
  `solved = false` and offer Save/Solve on a row already SOLVED in the DB —
  the incident this section's model fixes. Search runs the shared
  `scoreMatch` engine (`web/lib/fuzzySearch.js`) over name, role, faction,
  both zones, Discord handle, tag names, Move/Request kind and status, and
  the free text (a Move's description, a Request's reason/summary, GM notes)
  — a bare word matches anything, `field:term` (`role:smith`, `zone:caves`)
  or `@handle` narrows to one field, and a query reorders the list by match
  strength instead of the default sort — Open Moves first, Solved then
  Passed sinking toward the bottom (a locked-but-Solved row sinks too — the
  avatar is just riding along), newest-first within each rank. The
  Kind/Status/Type/Reviewed dropdowns always list every value the enum has,
  even at `(0)`, so "Open" never looks like it vanished just because nothing
  is open right now — Zone stays derived from what's actually loaded. The
  whole view survives a reload, split across three `sessionStorage` keys by
  write frequency (`web/app/components/useSessionState.js`): `gm-turns-rail`
  (filters per lens, the two travel toggles, the active lens — subscribed,
  click-frequency), `gm-turns-desk` (tray open/expanded, the inspected
  character, the History turn — Workspace.js's half), and `gm-turns-view`
  (search text and queue scroll position per lens — unsubscribed
  `readSession`/`writeSession`, debounced with a `pagehide` flush, restored
  by a post-hydration one-shot in `QueueRail.js`).
  Auto-filed **Travel** Moves (`db/lib/travel.js#performTravel`, no
  Routine/Gambit to review) render as "Travel" and stay hidden by default
  behind a "Show N travel" toggle beside the Kind dropdown; picking Travel
  from that dropdown always overrides the hide.
- **History lens** — the same rail over any turn, the open one included,
  picked from a Turn dropdown above the filters (the open turn first, marked
  `· open`, then the resolved ones newest first). A GM used to have to go to
  `/gm/audit` to see what somebody did last turn. Nothing is loaded with the
  page: for a **resolved** turn the lens fetches on demand
  (`actions.js#getMoveHistory`) and caches it for the page view, so the open
  turn's desk never pays for history nobody opened and the 45s refresh never
  re-sends it. The **open turn** costs nothing at all — its rows come straight
  from the live queue data `page.js` already ships, so the two lenses can't
  disagree, and picking a row opens the ordinary **live** desk rather than the
  read-only one. (That also means `MoveHistoryDesk` never renders for an
  unpushed turn, so a declared-vs-paid or unsent-message display can't be
  incoherent, and `getMoveHistory`'s RESOLVED guard stays intact.) Rows go
  through the same mappers the live queue does (`web/lib/moveRows.js`); on a
  pushed turn they open a **`MoveHistoryDesk`**: the
  Move's kind, dice, what was declared, what actually **paid**
  (`appliedEffects`), the Result, and everything that was sent on it. No lock,
  no composers, no Solve, no Reject — but a staged row the push never carried
  keeps its Edit/Delete, and a failed delivery keeps its Resend, because those
  are the two things about a past turn that can still need doing. A
  **Moves / Caving** switch beside the Turn picker (`historyKind`) reads back
  that turn's Caving Die rolls instead, mapped by the same `cavingRollRow`
  the live Caving lens uses and opening a **read-only `CavingDesk`** — see
  `CAVING.md` §5.
- **Desk** — the selected item. For a Move: situation, dice, declared
  numbers, the Result box, everything staged on it, and the three composers.
  Every button derives from `moveReviewStatus`, never from a display label or
  a lock: **Save · Solve · Reject** on an open Move, **Save · Reopen ·
  Reject** once it's Solved — Save stays live on a Solved Move (it edits
  freely; the status guard that used to block it protected nothing, since
  Solve is bookkeeping and nothing pays until the push), so fixing a Result
  after Solving no longer needs the Reopen → edit → re-Solve dance. For a
  Request: the old panel's sections, semantics untouched (§5). The
  90s cooperative lock, its 30s heartbeat and the `sendBeacon` release all
  carry over unchanged (`useMoveLock.js`,
  `web/app/api/move-lock/release/route.js`). Every card's meta line under the
  name leads with `roleTitle` (Move/Request/Caving desks alike), so who's
  acting reads at a glance before you open anything.
- **The composers do not cover the desk.** Every staging dialog here — message,
  declaration, effect, transfer, and the push preview — is **modeless**
  (`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` §8): no backdrop, clicks pass through, and the header
  drags, so a GM can pull someone up in the inspector while writing about them.
  Escape only closes one while focus is actually inside it. Under 1024px they
  revert to ordinary blocking modals. ‡

- **Inspector** — *"quickly pull up the guy he was talking to"*. Every
  character name in the workspace is a click target that swaps the column to
  that character: Sheet (live facts + gambit modifier), Tags, **Moves**, their
  archive slice, their DM thread. **Moves** is that person's own history —
  their newest 40 Moves on **past** turns, each row linking to
  `/gm/turns/history/<id>`. Both Move desks carry a **Past moves** button that
  opens it (`onInspect(characterId, name, "Moves")`). On `/gm/players` the
  same tab carries that desk's Canon section above the list, so this turn sits
  over everything before it (PLAYER-DESK.md §6). The header carries name, `@username`, and role on
  the line below, all from the roster DTO already on the client — no fetch
  needed just to see who someone is. A search box above the pin row
  (`InspectorSearch`, fuzzy-matched via `web/lib/fuzzySearch.js#scoreMatch`
  over name/role/faction/username/zone) opens anyone the same way, not just
  names already on screen. Pin the ones an arbitration keeps returning to.
  Fetched on demand via server actions, cached for the page view. Three quick
  edits live here too: the DMs tab carries a composer that sends immediately
  (»-prefixed, logged, not staged — `sendInspectorDm`); clicking an archived
  line opens `ArchiveContextModal` (`web/app/components/`), the ~30 messages before/after it in the
  same Discord channel/thread with a jump link when the message still exists
  (`getArchiveContext`); and the Sheet/Tags tabs stage deltas in place — ✕ a
  held tag to stage its removal, click Resources or Tag points to stage a
  ± delta. All three route through the same `createStagedEffects` the tray
  uses, so they land at the push like any other staged effect. `EffectComposer`'s
  own tag browser carries a "+ Custom tag" door too (`CustomTagDialog.js`,
  `DEV-PANEL.md` §8a) for inventing a one-off tag against the composer's
  current targets without leaving the modal.
- **Tray** — the push, honestly: counts (including how many open Moves will
  silently close), every staged row with edit/delete, batches as one line,
  unattached and detached rows, and the composers for staging outside any
  Move. **Preview push** groups it all by recipient — the DMs they'll get,
  net staged deltas, their declared payout — plus the public posts.
- **Missed-push banner** — staged rows a resolved turn's push never carried
  (a crash, a validation skip, the turn-boundary race) stay visible here
  with one verb: carry them onto the current turn for the next push.

**Responsiveness.** Five GMs share this page for a day at a time, so it
keeps itself current and stays reachable from the keyboard:

- The queue **refreshes itself** every 45s (`router.refresh()`), paused while
  a modal is open, while any panel holds unsaved edits
  (`useDirtyGuard.js#isAnyDirty`), or while the tab is hidden — a GM
  mid-sentence never gets the page yanked out from under them. The header
  carries an "updated HH:MM" stamp, a **countdown** to the nightly midnight
  CT push, and an `N/M solved` progress chip.
- The poll is **version-aware** (`useDeskVersion.js` + `/api/desk-version` +
  `web/lib/deployVersion.js`): it only calls `router.refresh()` after the
  server answers with the same build the page rendered from. Refreshing
  across a deploy trips Next's build-mismatch fallback — a full browser
  navigation that destroys all view state — and this repo deploys many times
  a day, which is exactly how the desk used to "refresh for no reason". Now
  a deploy latches a quiet **"Updated — reload when ready"** chip in the
  header (auto-refresh stands down until the GM clicks it), a switchover 5xx
  or dropped connection is a silently skipped tick, and once the flag has
  latched, a mutation that fails from the stale build says to reload
  (`mutationErrorMessage`) instead of "something went wrong". The one window
  left uncovered is a mutation inside the ≤45s between the deploy landing
  and the next poll noticing it — that can still fail generic, or succeed
  and have its `refresh()` trip the reload; the persisted view state is what
  makes that survivable.
- **Keyboard**: `↑↓` / `j k` walk the rail, `⏎` opens the focused row,
  `m`/`r`/`c`/`h` flip the lens, Escape peels the layers below. All of it stands down while a
  field has focus or a modal is open.
- **GM identity** shows as a small avatar (`GmAvatar.js`, roster from
  `web/lib/gmProfiles.js`) wherever a GM is named: the lock holder on an
  In Progress row, a staged row's author, a Move's solver, and the actor
  column on `/gm/audit`. The player desk's conversations get none —
  `DirectMessage` records the player, not which GM typed the reply.
- The **push preview is a way in**, not just a readout: a character name
  swaps the inspector to them, and a staged line closes the preview, opens
  and expands the tray, and scrolls to that row with a brief flash.
- **Pins survive a reload** and are **shared with the player desk**
  (`web/app/components/usePins.js`, `localStorage` read through
  `useSyncExternalStore`). Pin someone while adjudicating and they are pinned
  when you go talk to them. They self-heal on load, though: this desk passes
  `usePins({ knownIdentities })` with the live roster's character ids, so a
  pin for a character a wipe or a death removed quietly drops off the list
  instead of pointing at nothing. A message whose push left `deliveryFailures` grows
  a **Resend** button that retries only the recipients that failed
  (`resendStagedMessage`). The Result box has a **Stage as message** button
  that opens the message composer prefilled with the result text and the
  Move's own character.

Escape is layered, topmost-first: an open `Modal` handles its own Escape and
the workspace yields to it; otherwise a focused field just blurs, and a
selected Move/Request deselects through its own dirty guard (`Workspace.js`).
With nothing selected **Escape does nothing**. It used to navigate to
`/gm/players`, which made the desk read as a mode you were trapped in rather
than a page — one stray keystroke and the whole workspace was gone. The rail
is how you leave. The tray also
grew a search box, an All/Effects/Messages/Public filter, and an Expand
toggle for combing through a big push (`StagingTray.js`).

## 4. The push, from this page's side

The mechanics live in `db/lib/stagedPush.js` (ordering and crash-resume
guarantees: `TURN-ENGINE.md` §2–3). What a GM needs to know:

- Effects apply one transaction per row — one bad row can't roll back the
  batch. A row that no longer validates (the tag left the catalog, the
  staged zone was reworked away) is stamped errored with the reason on
  `appliedEffect`, shown in the tray.
- A staged relocation writes `Character.zoneId` in that same transaction;
  the Discord half (zone role, narrowcast, thread invites) runs afterwards
  in the side-effect thunk via `db/lib/zoneMove.js`, with the channel
  doctor as the safety net (`CHANNELS.md` §3).
- Messages are stamped `sentAt` after their sends are attempted, per-recipient
  failures recorded on the row and in one `staged_push_delivery_failed`
  audit row. A crash mid-delivery leaves the rest visibly unsent, not
  falsely delivered.
- A staged row created in the seconds around the cron retargets itself to
  the new open turn; anything that slips through lands in the missed-push
  banner. Honest beats locked.

## 5. Where player actions went

**There is no Requests lens any more.** The desk carries Moves, Caving and
History; a player action files no `Request` row, asks for no reason, and
cannot be undone (`REQUESTS.md` §1).

What a GM watches instead is **`/gm/audit`**, which now defaults to the player
band — the machine's own per-turn rows are one click away rather than on top
of everything. A single character's story is the **Audit** tab on
`/gm/dev/characters/[characterId]`.

Correcting a player action is a Dev Panel job, by hand: add the tag back, take
one off, transfer the ⬢ the other way, teleport them back. The audit row
carries a `restore` snapshot for exactly this — see `REQUESTS.md` §2, and
`DEV-PANEL.md` for the controls.

## 6. Structures at the desk

Damage, Repair, Destroy and Clear are a GM's ruling on a built thing — never a
Request, and never staged for the push. `/gm/structures` is a GM-visible page
reachable through ⌘K; it carries no rail item of its own.

All four are **immediate microactions**, the Dev Panel posture: a conditional
`updateMany` claims the row (so two GMs clicking at once land exactly one
change), each writes one `AuditLog` row (`structure_damaged` /
`structure_repaired` / `structure_destroyed` / `structure_cleared`), speaks an
ambient line into the structure's Location channel, and — Damage, Repair and
Destroy only, not Clear — DMs the structure's contributors and payer
(`stakeholderCharacterIds`, `db/lib/structures.js`). Clearing a wreck sends no
DM: the stakeholders already heard about the destruction or abandonment, and
"the rubble was tidied" is not news anyone needs.

**Destroy** takes any of the three present statuses
(`UNDER_CONSTRUCTION`/`COMPLETE`/`DAMAGED`) to `RUINED`. Sabotaging a site
still under construction destroys the work done, never silently — the crew
still get the destruction DM, same as a finished structure's contributors.

**Player demolition is a GAMBIT adjudicated at the desk, never an apply-first
Request.** The GM resolves the die, stages the public outcome through the
ordinary composer (§1), and clicks Destroy (or Damage, for a lesser outcome)
on `/gm/structures` in the same sitting — the ruling and its mechanical
consequence happen together, by hand.

**The two-turn siege.** An assault on a structure or a shut gate is staged as
a PUBLIC declaration into the defenders' `#summary` on turn N; it can only
resolve turn N+1, never the same turn — Moves lock at 21:00 CT and a sleeping
defender has to get their hours before the blow lands. The Destroy confirm
dialog on `/gm/structures` restates the rule at the point of clicking, so the
GM working the desk sees it again right before committing.

**The Move card's "Standing here:" line**
(`web/lib/moveRows.js#standingHereLines`) prints each structure's
`defenseNote` only while it is `COMPLETE` or `DAMAGED` — a ruin never grants
its clause. This is the siege licence in practice: the Battering Ram's note is
what makes storming a shut gate adjudicable at all, and it stops being
adjudicable the moment the Ram is a ruin.
