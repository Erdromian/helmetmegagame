# Commands, buttons, modals and reactions

The full player- and GM-facing Discord surface. Behaviour lives in the system
doc for each subsystem; this page is the index of what exists and where its
handler is.

Everything is dispatched from `bot/src/events/interactionCreate.js`, except
reactions (`bot/src/events/messageReactionAdd.js`).

## 1. Registration

Commands are defined in `bot/src/lib/commands.js` and registered **globally**
via `client.application.commands.set()` in `bot/src/events/ready.js`.

Global rather than per-guild because a guild command cannot appear in the
bot's DMs, whatever contexts it declares. The cost is propagation: a new or
renamed command can take up to an hour to appear. Registration is a full
replace, so removing a command from the array deregisters it.

`registerCommands` also **sweeps every guild's own command list empty** on
each boot. That full replace only ever replaces the *global* list, so when
registration moved from per-guild to global, everything the old code had
written into the guild stayed there — and Discord shows both copies in the
picker. `/gm` `/message` `/add` `/remove` appeared twice, and the four
retired `/hunt` `/fish` `/farm` `/herd` were still listed with no handler
left to answer them. Since registration is global, an empty guild-scoped
list is the correct state, so the sweep enforces it. Don't add a per-guild
registration back — it would be invisible in DMs *and* duplicate whatever the
global list already has.

Each command declares its contexts:

- `Guild` only — needs a channel or thread to act on.
- `Guild` + `BotDM` — usable anywhere, including the bot's DMs.

## 2. Slash commands

| Command | Options | Who | Contexts | Handler |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/move` | — | Living character | Guild, DM | `handleMoveOpen` |
| `/location` | — | Living character | Guild, DM | `handleTravelOpen` — the **Location** picker (§4) |
| `/travel` | — | Living character | Guild, DM | `handleTravelOpen` — the same picker, under the name people reach for |
| `/conceal` | — | Living character | Guild, DM | `handleConcealCommand` |
| `/message` | — | Living character | Guild, DM | `handleMessageCommand` |
| `/play` | — | Living character holding an Instrument | Guild | `handlePlayCommand` |
| `/shout` | `message` | Living character | Guild | `handleShoutCommand` — carries across the Location graph (§2d) |
| `/roll` | — | Anyone | Guild | `handleRollCommand` |
| `/add` | `character` (role) | Conversation or private-Room member, or GM | Guild | `handleThreadMemberCommand` |
| `/remove` | `character` (role) | Conversation or private-Room member, or GM | Guild | `handleThreadMemberCommand` |
| `/gm` | `message`, `attachment` | GM | Guild | `handleGmCommand` |
| `/dm` | `recipient` (user), `message` | GM | Guild | `handleGmDmCommand` |
| `/heal` | `character` (role) | GM | Guild | `handleHealCommand` |
| `/zone` | — | GM | Guild | `handleZoneCommand` — the select menu is `handleZoneViewPick` |

Notes:

- `/move`, `/location` and `/message` are the twins of the three console
  buttons in §3. Each opens the same flow.
- **`/travel` and `/location` are the same command.** `handleTravelOpen`
  answers both. `/location` is the historical name and stays registered so
  nobody's muscle memory breaks; `/travel` was added 2026-09-06 because that is
  what the thing is called everywhere else — the console button, the anchor
  button and this doc all say Travel. The BUTTON's `custom_id` is still
  `loc:open` and is not worth a migration; only the surface names changed.
  Retiring `/location` needs no deregistration step, since
  `client.application.commands.set` fully replaces the list.
- `/zone` is the Discord twin of the **Zones** control at the bottom of the
  inspector on `/gm/turns` and `/gm/players`. It takes no options: it opens an
  ephemeral select menu (`min_values: 0`) with the caller's current zones
  pre-selected, because toggling is something you do by looking at the current
  state rather than by retyping it. Choosing nothing means every zone. Both
  faces write `GmZoneView` and then call `syncGmZoneRoles`, which is what
  actually changes which Location channels the GM can see
  (`GAMEMASTERS.md` §6).
- `/conceal` toggles `Character.concealed`, a standing state rather than a
  per-message one — that's why it needs a DM context the same way `/location`
  does, rather than living only as a `/character` checkbox. See §2c.
- `/message` run inside a channel the player can already speak in skips the
  destination picker and posts there. Anywhere else — including a DM — it asks
  where first. See `PROXYING.md`.
- `/roll` is one flat 1d6, with no options and no game effect — it settles
  things at the table, nothing more. It reuses `rollDie()` from
  `db/lib/moveEffects.js` rather than adding a second source of randomness.
  Guild-only, because a die rolled in a DM has no audience. The result is
  posted as a **plain bot message**, not as a public interaction reply: a
  public reply carries Discord's "@account used /roll" header, which names the
  player behind the character (`PROXYING.md`). So the roll goes out anonymous,
  and the roller gets a separate ephemeral telling them which one was theirs.
- `/shout` takes a **string option** rather than opening a modal the way
  `/message` does. The modal exists so a player's real account never shows a
  typing indicator in a channel — filling in a slash-command option shows none
  either, so the protection is already there and the extra click buys nothing.
  See §2d.
- `/labor` is retired — laboring is now the **Labor checkbox** on the Move
  modal (`LABORING.md` §4).
- `/persistent` is retired too — Bascinet 2 dropped forum topics, private
  Create-a-Thread anchors and any long-lived form of a player-made thread.
  The only thread a player can open now is a Conversation, and every
  Conversation is wiped clean at the next Dawn regardless (`CHANNELS.md` §4).
- `/dm` was named `/message` until `/message` became the player-facing speak
  command.
- Commands taking a character take a **role** option, not a user option, so
  the picker names characters rather than Discord accounts. The role is the
  character's personal name-token role (`CHANNELS.md` §3).

### 2b. `/add` and `/remove` in detail

Both work on two things, and **the channel decides which**:
a `PlayerThread` row means a **Conversation**, a `Room` row means a **private
Room** (§2b-ii). A public Room takes neither — everyone standing in the
Location can already read it — and anywhere else refuses.

#### 2b-i. In a Conversation

**`/add` works on any `ALIVE` character, wherever they stand.** There is no
location gate. Discord refuses (or quietly sheds) a thread member who can't
view the parent Location channel, so the command records a
**`PlayerThreadInvite`** row first — that is what survives when the Discord
add can't land yet — and then attempts the add. If the target is already
standing **here** (`target.locationId === row.locationId`) it lands
immediately; otherwise `db/lib/threadInvites.js#applyPendingInvites` replays
it the moment they arrive, called from `applyLocationMoveSideEffects` on
every move (`MAP.md` §4). Adds are **silent**: the REST thread-members
endpoint is used rather than `channel.members.add`, which would ping-mention
them in the channel. The target is DM'd instead — where they were let in, and
a link, never the content. Discord's own "added to a thread" notice is easy to
miss and says nothing about where.
Mentions into a Conversation follow the same contract — a character-role
mention there is also an invite (`bot/src/events/messageCreate.js`).

**`/remove`** deletes the invite row and then removes the thread member. If the
bot is missing `Manage Threads` the caller is told so, rather than seeing "the
application did not respond".

#### 2b-ii. In a private Room

The other way into a private Room, and the only one that isn't a key
(`CHANNELS.md` §4a). `/add` writes a **`RoomGuest`** row, adds the thread
member and sends the same DM.

Three differences from the Conversation form, all downstream of the grant
being **spent when the guest leaves the Location**:

- **The target must already be standing there.** A row handed to somebody
  across the map would be deleted before they ever saw the door.
- **They stay until they leave.** `syncCharacterRoomAccess` drops every guest
  row that isn't where the character now stands, so walking out is what shuts
  the door. Coming back needs a fresh `/add`.
- **`/remove` refuses a key-holder** — *"Their key admits them. Take the
  key."* Removing them would undo itself on their next arrival, so the honest
  answer is to name the real removal.

A guest gets the room's **full reach**, not just the thread: the stash, the
Transfer dialog, Storage, equipment standing there, corpse handling. That
falls out of `accessibleRooms()` being the one predicate behind all of them.

Both forms are open to anyone already in the thread (checked via
`channel.members.fetch`), plus GMs — the same posture as pinging someone in,
which any participant can already do.

### 2c. `/conceal` in detail

`Character.concealed` is a standing toggle, not a per-message prefix — there
is no more typed prefix to open a message with. `handleConcealCommand`
(`bot/src/events/interactionCreate.js`) flips it, writes a
`character_conceal_toggled` `AuditLog` row, and replies naming the alias:
"You now speak as **a young man**. Nobody sees your name until you run
`/conceal` again." / "You speak under your own name again."

While concealed, every message proxies under `concealedAlias(character)`
with the unknown-silhouette avatar (`messageCreate.js`), and the **Who's
here?** anchor button lists the character under that same alias, with no
Role shown (§4). The web app carries the identical toggle as a `<Switch>` on
`/character`, next to turn-ping (`AvatarField.js`).

### 2d. `/shout` in detail

The one thing a character can say that leaves the room they said it in. It is
the only speech in the game that crosses the Location graph.

**Who hears it.** `db/lib/locationGraph.js#soundRange` BFSes out from wherever
the character *stands* — not from whatever channel the command was typed in;
those can disagree and only one of them is a place a voice comes from — and
returns every Location within four hops, each with the distance and the
direction. **Every edge counts.** Locked, hidden, shut, on-foot — sound does
not care, because none of those are about sound. A portcullis you
cannot open is still a portcullis you can yell through. It is deliberately the
one traversal in the game that never calls `crossingCheck`.

**Who may shout.** The SPEAK capability (`TAGS.md` §5f) — so Mute, Paralyzed,
Unconscious and mid-Seizure refuse, and **Bound deliberately does not**. Being
tied up takes your hands, not your voice, and a hostage nobody can hear is a
hostage nobody can rescue. The check runs *before* the cooldown is claimed, so
a refused shout does not burn the throat timer.

**What they hear**, from `db/lib/shout.js`:

| Distance | The line |
|---|---|
| 0 — your own Location | Full size: "You hear someone shout:" and the words |
| 1 | `-#` subtext: "…from the direction of *X*", words clear |
| 2 | the same, 40% of the letters replaced with `░ ▒ ▓` |
| 3 | the same, 70% replaced |
| 4 | "…from the direction of *X*, but you can't make out what they say." |

Distance takes the **words** away before it takes the **direction** away. You
always learn which way to run; you stop learning what was said.

**The direction is never the source.** `viaName` is the *hearer's own
neighbour* on the shortest path back — the next step toward the noise, which is
the only part of it a person standing there could actually tell. Ties between
two equally-short ways back resolve by lowest slug, so a shout cannot name one
direction on Tuesday and another on Wednesday for no reason a player can see.

**And it is withheld entirely when that step is a hidden way.** Sound still
carries through a secret crawl — that is the rule — but the line drops to "you
hear someone shout somewhere nearby", because naming the crawl would tell a
player a way exists where every travel list has told them none does. That is
the whole reason `hidden` refuses in the same words a nonexistent edge does
(`MAP.md` §2a), and a shout must not be the hole in it. The suppression is
**not** sticky: only the hearer's own step counts, so a shout from deep in the
caves still tells somebody out on the road which way down the road it came
from.

**Nobody is ever named**, at any distance including zero. That is what lets a
concealed character shout without unmasking, and it is also just true — you
hear a shout before you find out whose it was.

Distance 0 is full size and everything past it is `ambientLine` subtext, the
same split `/play` makes: the room hears the performance, the street outside
only notices it. Only Location **channels** get it, never the Room threads under
them — somebody in a private back room is behind a door.

**Except the room you are standing in.** Shout from inside a Room or a
Conversation and the thread gets the full-size line too, before the loop runs.
Without that one exception the only room that certainly heard you would be the
only room that didn't.

**Rate limits.** One shout is up to a couple of dozen REST posts, so the posting
loop is sequential with every post individually caught, the discipline
`bot/src/lib/deathSmell.js` documents — never `Promise.all`. On top of that
there is a 5-minute per-character cooldown, in memory like `/play`'s, and it is
**claimed before the loop rather than after**: the loop takes real seconds,
which is exactly long enough for a second `/shout` to slip past a cooldown
stamped at the end.

### 2e. The bell and the trumpet

The two things that are *loud* rather than spoken. They share one machine,
`db/lib/soundBroadcast.js#broadcastSound`, which is `/shout`'s cousin over the
same `soundRange` BFS — with the two things that make a shout a shout removed.

**Nothing muffles.** A shout loses its words with distance because a shout *is*
words. Neither of these has any to lose, so all distance changes is whether the
line lands in the conversation or under it. **And no direction**: `soundRange`
offers a `viaName` and a shout needs it, but a bell hangs in a tower you can see
from the square, so naming the way to it tells nobody anything.

So the only thing left is a volume band, and it is purely a formatting call —
full size near the source, `ambientLine` subtext past it. ‡

| | Origin | Reach | Full size | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bell** | the Cathedral, fixed | 7 hops | 0–4 | 30 min, global (`GameConfig.bellRungAt`) |
| **Trumpet** | wherever the holder stands | 5 hops | 0–3 | 30 min, per character, in memory |

The trumpet's numbers are **derived** from the bell's at 0.75×, rounded, rather
than written out — the ratio is the design, so retuning the bell moves the
trumpet with it instead of leaving the two to disagree (`db/lib/trumpet.js`).

From the Cathedral the bell is 20 Locations loud and 16 quiet; the trumpet is
12 and 16.

**Rock stops sound, and the rule is symmetric** — a Location hears it only if
its `Zone.kind` matches the origin's. A bell in the Cathedral must not ring in
the Depths, which any version of this gives you; but a trumpet blown underground
must still be heard by the people standing next to the trumpeter, and a plain
"surface only" filter made it audible everywhere *except* down there. Comparing
against the origin says the actual thing rather than describing the wiring.

That filter replaced an allowlist of four zone slugs posting into zone
`#summary` channels, which could not say that the Square hears the bell better
than the far Marshes do, and made the Black Hills deaf to a bell they stand
close enough to hear.

**Who may.** The bell is whoever can reach the rope — the Bell Tower's `Sound
Bell` button, confirmed by typing `RING` into a modal, because one click is
heard across most of the barony and cannot be taken back. The trumpet is
whoever holds the `trumpet` tag, and its button is on the **web Character
page**, not in Discord: "only if you have one" is a per-reader question, and a
Discord button sits on an anchor message everybody shares. It asks for a
confirm for the same reason the rope does. Sounding it takes ACT, not SPEAK — a
trumpet needs breath *and* hands, so Bound stops it where it deliberately would
not stop a shout.

Both write an AuditLog row (`bell_rung`, `trumpet_sounded`), and both claim
their cooldown **before** the posting loop, for `/shout`'s reason: the loop is
two or three dozen REST posts and takes real seconds.

## 3. The `#turns` console

The buttons ride on the rolling turn announcement — `#turns` is one message,
reposted each turn by `db/lib/turnAnnouncement.js#postTurnsConsole`, so the
console is always the last thing in the channel (see `TURN-ENGINE.md` for why
it stopped being three separate messages).

`bot/src/lib/turnsConsole.js#ensureTurnsConsole` runs on ready and is only the
cold start: it locks the channel down and posts the message if none exists —
a fresh guild, or a repost that failed. Restart Game used to be the common
case: it clears `#turns` and does not advance a turn, so the channel stayed
empty through Day 1. It now reposts the console itself
(`web/app/(app)/gm/dev/actions.js#finishGameWipe`), and this is the backstop
behind it. The buttons themselves are one shared definition in
`db/lib/turnsConsoleRow.js`, plain component JSON because the REST side (the
web Dev Panel's End Turn) and the gateway side both post it.

`@everyone` is denied `SendMessages` in `#turns`. Anything typed there is
deleted and files nothing.

| Button | Emoji | customId | Opens |
|---|---|---|---|
| Travel | 🗺️ | `loc:open` | The Location picker (§4) |
| Move | ⚜️ | `move:open` | The Move modal (§5) |
| Speak | 🔊 | `say:open` | The Speak picker (§5) |

Tracked on `GameConfig.turnsConsoleChannelId` / `turnsConsoleMessageId`.

## 4. Component custom IDs

`namespace:verb` for singletons, `namespace:verb:{id}` where an id is needed,
parsed by literal `startsWith` + `slice`.

| customId | Type | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `loc:open` | Button | Offer the connected Locations |
| `loc:pick` | Select | Pick a destination Location |
| `loc:drag:{locationId}` | Select | Pick who to bring along (min 0) |
| `loc:confirm:{locationId}` | Button | Execute the travel |
| `loc:cancel` | Button | Dismiss |
| `loc:who:{locationId}` | Button | Reply privately with who's standing here (§ below) |
| `loc:secret:{locationId}` | Button | Reply privately with the private Rooms and Conversations here you can see |
| `loc:converse:{locationId}` | Button | Offer the Rooms you can link a new Conversation to |
| `room:storage:{roomId}` | Button | Reply privately with what's lying in the Room's stash (`CARRY.md` §7) |
| `room:intercom:{roomId}` | Button | Show the Intercom modal. **Council Room only**, and the one button here that must NOT be `ack()`'d — `showModal` is the acknowledgement |
| `intercom:send:{roomId}` | Modal | Broadcast the PA (`CHANNELS.md` §7a) |
| `conv:room:{locationId}` | Select | Pick which Room to link the Conversation to, then show the Converse modal |
| `conv:new:{roomId}` | Modal | Create the Conversation |
| `move:open` | Button | Show the Move modal |
| `say:open` | Button | Show the Speak picker |
| `say:pick` | Select | Pick a destination, then show the Speak modal |
| `heal:pick:{characterId}` | Select | Clear the chosen afflictions |
| `edit:open:{messageId}` | Button | Show the Edit-message modal, prefilled |
| `edit:send:{messageId}` | Modal | Rewrite a proxied message |
| `offer:accept:{offerId}` | Button | Accept a Lesson or Bind `Offer` |
| `offer:decline:{offerId}` | Button | Decline a Lesson or Bind `Offer` |

Retired with the zone rework: `zone:place`, `zone:confirm:{zoneId}`,
`zone:cancel`, `zone:who:{zoneId}`, `topic:new:{zoneId}`,
`topic:create:{zoneId}`, `priv:new:{zoneId}`, `priv:create:{zoneId}`.

**The two `edit:` ids arrive in a DM**, from the button the ✏️ reaction sends
(`bot/src/lib/editModal.js`, `PROXYING.md` §4). `interaction.guild` and
`.member` are null there, so both handlers resolve the author from
`recentProxies` rather than from the guild — and `edit:open:` opens a modal, so
it is one of the handlers that must **not** ack first.

**The two `offer:` ids also arrive in a DM**, on the message `db/lib/offerRow.js`
builds for a Lesson or Bind `Offer`'s responder (`LESSONS.md` §3). Handled by
`bot/src/lib/offers.js`, routed in `interactionCreate.js` alongside the `edit:`
namespace. The click's acknowledgement is `interaction.update()`: the buttons
come off the message and the outcome is written under it in place, so nothing
can be clicked twice and no message id needs to be stored elsewhere.

**The travel flow lives in `bot/src/lib/locationTravel.js`, all
`loc:`-namespaced** (`bot/src/events/interactionCreate.js`). The console
button keeps its historical id, `loc:open` — that id is baked into every
standing `#turns` console message, so renaming it would break every console
posted before the rework, and it is also the id the three anchor buttons'
namespace was chosen to match. `handleTravelOpen` (the `/location` twin too)
offers the current Location's direct neighbours (`Location.connectsTo`), or
every non-cave Location for a character who has none yet — arriving is not
travel. Picking one (`handleTravelPick`) shows the cost as an option
description and a `-#` line rather than asking the server anything: "Same
zone" (free, on a cooldown), "Crosses into {Zone} — costs your Move", or
"Arriving costs you nothing" on a first placement.

**Every hop always offers dragging**, on the same message as the Confirm/
Cancel row: `loc:drag:{locationId}` lists zone-mates (not just Location-mates)
who are a corpse, hold an incapacitating tag, or are in the mover's faction
if the mover leads it — `db/lib/locationTravel.js#dragCandidates`. The select
is `minValues: 0`, and `buildDragRow` returns `null` (dropping the row
entirely) when there is nobody to bring, since Discord rejects an empty
select. The picked list is **not** carried on the component — Discord hands
the Confirm click no memory of what the drag select last held — so
`handleTravelDrag` parks it in an in-memory `Map` keyed on Discord user id,
`DRAG_TTL_MS` = 10 minutes, same posture as `recentProxies`
(`bot/src/lib/proxy.js`): a missing entry means "nobody picked", never a
gate. `handleTravelConfirm` re-resolves and re-authorizes everyone server-side
inside `performLocationMove`'s own transaction (`canDrag`) — a candidate who
wandered off between the picker and the confirm fails the whole move rather
than being silently dropped. See `MAP.md` §3.

**The three anchor buttons ride on the Location anchors**
(`db/lib/locationAnchorRow.js` — plain component JSON, because the sync
posts them over REST from `db/`, which has no discord.js, while the bot
answers the clicks over the gateway). The Location id rides in the custom id
so the handlers need no channel→Location lookup; change a prefix in that
file and you must change it in `interactionCreate.js` too.

- **Who's here?** (`handleWhosHere`) lists everyone `ALIVE` and standing in
  this Location: named characters first (with their `roleTitle` shown to a
  fellow member of the same real faction, same rule the 🔍 inspect gate
  uses), then concealed characters as their alias with an article — "a young
  man" — and no title, since a Role is as identifying as a name. Nobody here
  ⇒ "Nobody is here."
- **Secret rooms?** (`handleSecretRooms`) lists the private Rooms this
  character's held tags admit them to (`db/lib/roomAccess.js#accessibleRooms`)
  and the Conversations here they created or were invited to — two separate
  lines, each dropped when empty; nothing at all ⇒ "No secret rooms for you
  here."
- **Converse** (`handleConverseOpen`) offers every Room here the character
  can see (public, plus private ones their tags admit) via `conv:room:`; that
  select's handler, `handleConverseRoomPick`, must **not** ack — it goes
  straight to `showModal` — so the picker outliving a player's departure is
  caught on submit instead. `handleConverseCreate` re-checks the character is
  still standing in the Room's Location, opens a private, non-invitable
  thread on the **Location channel** (Discord has no threads inside threads,
  so the Room is only the link the whisper poll reads), adds the creator
  silently, and writes the `PlayerThread` row (`locationId`, `roomId`) plus a
  `conversation_opened` `AuditLog` entry.

`say:nav` is the value carried by a **group header** option in the Speak
picker. Discord select menus have no option groups, so headers are ordinary
options; picking one re-renders the panel unchanged.

## 5. Modals

Three modals. All need discord.js >= 14.27 for the component types involved:
`Label` (18) wrapping a `TextInput` (4), `RadioGroup` (21) or `Checkbox` (23),
plus a bare `TextDisplay` (10) for the `-#` line.

A modal must be shown within 3 seconds of the interaction and **cannot be
deferred first**. That is why the Move button opens its modal directly — it
makes the single cheap cutoff check below and falls through to the modal if
that read fails, since submit checks it again — while Converse and Speak both
go through a picker first (enumerating Rooms or threads costs API calls), so
each picker's handler shows the modal with nothing awaited, and every real
gate runs on submit instead.

### Move — `move:new` (`bot/src/lib/moveModal.js`)

| Field | customId | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Your Move | `move:body` | Paragraph, required, max 1800 |
| Kind | `move:kind` | Radio: `ROUTINE` / `GAMBIT`, required |
| Labor | `move:labor` | Checkbox — Routine only, refused on a Gambit |

Moves close three hours before the turn ends — 9:00 AM / 9:00 PM
America/Chicago — so a GM can adjudicate what was filed before the push
(`TURN-ENGINE.md` §6a). Both `move:open` and the submit handler check it: the
button refuses to open the modal after the cutoff, and submit re-checks because
a modal can sit open on screen across it. Either way the refusal is ephemeral
and names the cutoff and the next turn's start. Travel, Speak, requests and the
auto-labor pass are untouched.

Submitting runs every gate the old `#turns` message flow ran — living
character, open turn, before the cutoff, hasn't already acted, non-empty body,
Labor resolved **before** any `Action` row exists so a refusal never costs a
turn — then
locks the Move in through `bot/src/lib/moveConfirm.js#confirmMove` and
replies ephemerally. **Submit = locked**: there is no edit window, the dice
and resource roll happen now, and the payout — like every Move payout — lands
at the turn-end push (`ADJUDICATION.md`). See `TURN-ENGINE.md`.

### Converse — `conv:new:{roomId}` (`bot/src/lib/converseModal.js`)

| Field | customId | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Name | `conv:name` | Short, required, max 90 |

Replaces the two creation modals of the zone rework (Create a Topic, Create a
Private Thread) — players no longer make Rooms, only Conversations, and a
Conversation is always private and always linked to a Room. The Room id rides
the custom id, coming straight off the `conv:room:` select that opened this
(§4), so submit needs no channel→Room lookup; every gate runs on submit
(`handleConverseCreate`): a living character, still standing in the Room's
Location — the select lives on an ephemeral message that can outlive a
player walking out of the Location, same posture the old topic/private
modals took toward the zone.

On success the bot opens a private, non-invitable thread on the Room's
**Location channel** (Discord has no threads inside threads), adds the
creator silently, and writes the `PlayerThread` row (`locationId`, `roomId`)
plus a `conversation_opened` audit entry. Players hold no create-thread
permission anywhere — the bot makes every Conversation, which is what keeps
`PlayerThread` a complete record. See `CHANNELS.md` §4.

### Speak — `say:send:{channelId}` (`bot/src/lib/speakModal.js`)

| Field | customId | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Message | `say:body` | Paragraph, required, max 1800 |

The Conceal checkbox and the attachment field are both gone. Concealment is
no longer asked per-message — it's the standing `Character.concealed` toggle
(`/conceal`, §2c), read off the character rather than the modal, so a post
while concealed goes out under `concealedAlias(character)` with no extra
choice to make on submit.

Destinations come from `bot/src/lib/speakTargets.js#listSpeakTargets`, which
keeps anything that is **both** a tupper channel and one Discord says the
member may actually post in. That second test is the live answer to every
narrowcast rule without a second copy of them, so a channel added later
appears automatically.

"May post in" is two different permissions, and conflating them is a bug:

| Target | Needs |
|---|---|
| Text / forum channel | `ViewChannel` + `SendMessages` |
| Thread | `ViewChannel` + `SendMessagesInThreads` |

The two thread containers are **never** offered as destinations themselves —
you cannot post a message to a forum channel, and `#private` denies
`SendMessages` for `@everyone` by design (`CHANNELS.md` §2). Both are walked
for their threads on `ViewChannel` alone. A private thread additionally
requires the member to be in it.

Grouped Room / Threads / Broadcast, each group prefixed by a header option and
its entries carrying a group emoji, capped at Discord's 25 options with the
overflow counted rather than dropped silently. **Every option value must be
unique** — Discord rejects the whole payload otherwise, and `discord.js` does
not check this locally, so each group header carries its own `say:nav:{group}`
value rather than a shared one.

The destination is re-checked on submit: an ephemeral picker outlives its
player walking out of the room.

### Intercom — `intercom:send:{roomId}` (`bot/src/lib/intercomModal.js`)

| Field | customId | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Announcement | `intercom:body` | Paragraph, required, max 1200 |

The button lives on the Council Room's starter post, and standing in that room
is the whole gate — there is no tag any more (`CHANNELS.md` §7a). Like Speak,
the gate is re-checked on **submit**, because an ephemeral modal outlives its
player walking out of the Keep.

The SPEAK check rides along on submit, and never on open (`showModal` *is*
the acknowledgement, so that handler cannot `ack` first). Hearing is not
checked at all: a shout and a PA both land in shared Discord channels, so
nothing can hide a broadcast from one character, and not hearing stays
roleplay. See `TAGS.md` §5f.

1200 characters is not arbitrary. The composed line has to fit one Discord
message per zone: the broadcast pings `@here`, and a chunked message would ping
once per chunk.

## 6. Reactions

All in `bot/src/events/messageReactionAdd.js`, all gated on `recentProxies`
except 🌫️ and ⭐. Each is stripped back off after being processed.

| Emoji | Who | Does |
|---|---|---|
| ❌ | Owner or GM | Delete the message and its `ArchiveEntry` |
| ✏️ / 📝 | Owner | DM-based edit |
| 🔍 / 🔎 | Anyone | Inspect embed, gated by the viewer's own tags |
| ❓ | Anyone | DM the character's bio |
| ⭐ | Anyone | Save a personal `Note` — works on any bot- or webhook-authored message, not just a tracked proxy (`PROXYING.md` §7) |
| 📸 / 📷 | Anyone holding an Instant Camera | Mint a **Photo** tag of the speaking character |
| ⚜️ | GM | Full dossier on the speaking character |
| 🌫️ | GM | Delete and repost as the bot, de-attributing it |

There used to be a 🌬️ ghost whisper here — one haunting line a dead player
could breathe into a channel, on a 12-real-hour cooldown tracked in a
`GhostWhisper` table. It is **gone**, along with the table and
`db/lib/ghostWhisper.js`. A ghost has no voice now. The thing that reports an
unburied body is the body: `bot/src/lib/deathSmell.js` nags the Location it is
lying in every 4–10 real hours (`CORPSES.md` §5), which says the same thing
without needing the dead player to be at their keyboard to say it.

Every refusal except the cooldown is silent, on purpose: a visible "you can't
do that" would tell the living that someone specific is watching. The cooldown
answers by DM for the same reason.

⚜️ applies **no** vision gates — every tag, the Desire, this
turn's Action, and the real name even on a concealed message. It has **no
channel fallback** when the DM bounces, unlike every other embed here:
posting it in the channel would hand the room everything it hides.

⚜️ is also the Move button's emoji. Buttons and reactions share no namespace,
so this is not a collision.

**📸 is 🔍 that stopped moving.** Both run
`readoutForReaction()` — one function on purpose, for `db/lib/examine.js`'s own
reason: a divergence between what you see when you look and what the camera
catches would be invisible until a player noticed one surface saying something
the other wouldn't. The difference is what happens next. 🔍 DMs the embed and
that is the end of it; 📸 also freezes the readout onto a runtime `Tag` row
(`db/lib/photoMint.js`), which is a real object — it can be handed over,
stashed, stolen, and shown to somebody who was not there, long after the
subject has changed clothes. Both refuse a blind reactor.

Three rules follow from a print being permanent and transferable where a DM is
neither:

- **The camera reads as a bystander** (`bystander: true`). No doctor's eye, no
  Seductive — a lens has no medical training. Without it a surgeon could
  photograph their own diagnosis and hand the print to a layman, which is the
  one way that gate could be laundered.
- **A hood photographs as a hood, even one since taken off.** Concealment is
  derived from live equipment, so a plain re-read would unmask somebody
  retroactively; the reaction passes `wasConcealedAs` (the alias the room
  actually saw, off `recentProxies`) and `examineReadout` honours it outright.
  For 🔍 that was one wrong DM; for 📸 it would be a print filed forever under
  a real name nobody present ever heard.
- **One shot per message per photographer.** Nothing is spent, so re-reacting
  would otherwise mint unbounded permanent catalog rows. Photographing the same
  moment twice is the same photo.

**The camera is not spent.** Holding one is the entire gate; film is not a
system anybody asked for. The *other* thing you can do with a camera is Consume
it on `/character`, which points it at nothing and hands back a blank Photo —
that path is special-cased in `consumeTagRequestImpl` exactly the way a
`SEALED` letter is, because a photo is a runtime row no `consumesInto:` slug
could ever name.
