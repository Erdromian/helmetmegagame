# Portraits

The in-app portrait maker: the "Customize Appearance" button on `/character`,
the sprite-sheet catalog behind it, and how a picked face becomes the bytes in
`Character.avatarData`.

Everything here is web-only. The bot never renders a portrait — it reads the
avatar through the same `/api/avatar/[characterId]` route as before, which
doesn't care how the picture got there.

`web/app/components/CharacterAvatar.js` is the shared renderer for that route
— every GM surface that shows a character's face (the player desk rail and
roster, the adjudication queue, the dev panel, a conversation header) uses it
rather than hand-rolling another `<img>`. It needs `characterId` and a
`version` (the character's `updatedAt.getTime()`) — the route answers with an
immutable `Cache-Control`, so a stale version is how a GM keeps seeing a face
from before the last rename or portrait change.

## 1. What a player sees

`AvatarField` (inside the Bio form on `/character`) offers up to three things:

| Control | Shown when |
|---|---|
| **Customize Appearance** | always |
| **Browse** (upload your own) | `GameConfig.avatarUploadsEnabled` |
| **Reset to Default** | the character has a picture of either kind |

They are independent. With uploads off and no picture on file, the field
reads "Using your letter plaque", exactly as it did before this existed.

**Browse carries a hover note reading "Requires GM approval, run your art by
the GM."** There is now a queue behind that sentence — see §1a. The upload
still lands immediately; what changed is that a GM can see it and take it down.

**Reset to Default** clears `avatarData`, `avatarMimeType`, `portrait` and
`avatarSetAt`, and that is all it does. The timestamp goes with the picture:
somebody who takes their own upload down has left nothing to review, and a
queue row pointing at a face that is gone is a row nobody can act on. The letter plaque is derived from `firstName` at read time
by the avatar route, so there is nothing to restore — see the comment at the
top of `web/scripts/generate-letters.js`.

## 1a. Reviewing an upload

The queue lives on `/gm/turns`, as a fourth kind on the **Other** lens —
the lens named for its shape rather than its contents, "where the next thing
that is neither a Move nor a die goes" (`ATTACK.md` §7). The row shows the
picture at 40px, the character's name, and two buttons.

**Uploads only.** The portrait maker cannot produce anything to review: the
client posts part and palette indices, never pixels, and they are re-rendered
server-side from the committed sheets (§4). Putting maker faces in the queue
would bury the handful of real uploads under a hundred jaws off the artist's
own art. `Character.portrait` is what tells the two apart and needs no new
column to do it — the maker stores its selection there, and an upload leaves it
null.

**It is not a gate.** The picture is live from the moment it is saved, exactly
as before. Keep and Reject decide whether it stays.

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Keep** | Stamps `avatarReviewedAt`. No audit row — nothing about the game changed, and `/gm/audit` should not fill with "a GM looked at a picture". |
| **Reject** | Clears the picture the way the player's own Reset to Default does, writes one `gm_avatar_rejected` audit row, and DMs them. |

Two columns carry the state, both nullable:

- **`avatarSetAt`** — stamped by the **upload branch** of
  `updateCharacterProfile` and by nothing else. Not by the maker, and not off
  `updatedAt`, which every rename and appearance edit bumps and so cannot say
  "they changed their picture".
- **`avatarReviewedAt`** — stamped by Keep and by Reject.

A picture is waiting when it is an upload and `avatarSetAt` is newer than
`avatarReviewedAt`, which makes **a re-upload after a Keep come back** for
free. `db/lib/avatarReview.js` is the only place that sentence is written: a
pure `avatarNeedsReview` for the tests, and the Prisma `where` beside it.

**The null arm of that query is not optional.** A comparison never matches a
NULL column, so `avatarReviewedAt: { lt: … }` on its own would silently drop
every picture nobody has looked at yet — which is the entire queue. Both arms
are spelled out, and `db/test/avatarReview.test.js` fails if one goes missing.

Nothing here is scoped to the open turn, unlike every other Other row: a
portrait is not a thing that happened this turn, it is a thing that is still
true. It carries no zone either, so it stays visible to every GM whatever they
have ticked in "Zones I see" — a picture belongs to nobody's patch of map, and
one only the Marshes GM can see is one nobody reviews.

Rejecting relies on the plaque being derived from `firstName` at read time, so
there is nothing to restore, and on `updatedAt` bumping by itself, which is
what retires the immutably-cached image URL every surface is holding.

## 2. The art

Fifteen sprite sheets under `web/public/assets/portrait/`, ~110KB in total.
They are the artist's own sheets, unmodified: 128×128 tiles, six to a row,
indexed row-major. `web/assets/portrait-source-notes.txt` is their README,
kept for the layering order and the two-part convention it documents.

Two things about the format drive the whole design:

- **Several parts are two layers, not one.** A hairstyle is a `hair-front`
  tile *and* the `hair-back` tile at the same index; the same goes for ears and
  for eyes/pupils and for the layered accessories. Neither half is a look on
  its own, which is why the picker has ten rows and the renderer has fifteen
  layers.
- **The colours are placeholders.** Skin, hair and pupils are painted in flat
  ramps that the original tool swapped through a shader. We do the same swap in
  a pixel loop. Nothing in the sheets is the colour it will be on screen.

`plate.webp` — the stone backing — is *not* from the artist. It's the letter
plaque's own plate minus its inset rule, generated by
`npm run assets:letters --workspace=web` so the two share one set of tuning
constants and can't drift apart in a gallery. **That script has a trap: read
its header before running it.**

**The plate is neutral grey as of 2026-09-06**, Bascinet's call — `TINT` is
`null` and `DARKEN` came down from 0.5 to 0.4, so it is fully desaturated and
about 18% darker in luminance. It was a lamplit teal (`#27443e`) before that.
Put a `{ r, g, b }` back in `TINT` to bring a hue back; `buildPlate()` skips
the tint pass entirely when it is null, because tinting an already-greyscale
plate with a grey only flattens it again.

**Two of the three families were rebuilt properly and the third could not be.**
The plate itself and all 21 helms were regenerated (neither needs a font), so
only their backgrounds moved and the helm sprites kept their own colour. The 27
letter plaques were **post-processed in place** over the committed WebPs,
because the fontconfig trap in `generate-letters.js` is still live on Bascinet's
Mac and a full run would have replaced every blackletter glyph with Helvetica.
That map pinned the *top* of a plaque onto the new plate, but the plaques
already carried the shade ramp, so everything below the top drifted and the
shadows clipped: the plaques ended up 15–25 luma darker than the plate, the
helms and the built portraits, and crushed to black at the bottom edge.

**That divergence was closed on 2026-09-06, toward the plaques rather than away
from them** — Bascinet's call was that the darker ground is the one to keep. The
plate now carries a final tone map, `TONE_GAIN` / `TONE_OFFSET` in
`generate-letters.js`, fitted by least squares over all 240 unclipped rows of
the committed plaques (max residual 2.2 luma). It reproduces the plaque ground
from the plate, so the plate, the helms and every built portrait land where the
plaques already were — measured worst-case row difference is now 3.4 luma.

Three things about that map. It is a `linear()` and not a smaller `DARKEN`
because it raises contrast and subtracts, and `modulate({ brightness })` is a
pure multiply. It sits **last in `buildPlate()`, on the ground alone** — the
glyph, the helm sprite and the portrait bust are all composited after it, so the
ground darkens and the foreground does not. And the 27 plaques are now the
*reference*, not a debt: nothing is owed to them, and a future run on a
font-capable machine will produce plaques matching what they already are.

The helm and portrait bottom fade went to **true black** in the same pass
(`FADE_TINT` `{0,0,0}`, `FADE_DARKEN` `1`, in both `generate-helms.js` and
`web/lib/portrait/catalog.js`). The plate's tone map crushes its own bottom edge
to zero, so a fade toward anything lighter would lift that edge back up — the
same mismatch upside down. The fade still earns its place: it sinks the *sprite
or bust's* lower edge into the shade, which the plate's ramp cannot do because
the subject is composited on top of it.

`--plate-only` exists for exactly this split: it rebuilds `plate.webp` and
stops, so the plate's tuning can change on a machine that cannot render the
font.

The plate is not evenly lit. `buildPlate()` composites a vertical black ramp
over the stone — nothing for the top 15%, then falling to 0.5 opacity at
the bottom edge — so anything standing on it sits in light at the top and sinks
into shade at its base. It lives in the plate rather than in either renderer
deliberately: one file, and a built portrait, a helm avatar and a letter plaque
are all lit the same way with no code in common. It is a separate sharp pass
from the tint, because chaining anything onto `.tint()` silently flattens the
plate to greyscale.

## 3. One catalog, two renderers

`web/lib/portrait/catalog.js` is the source of truth: layers, draw order,
groups, palettes, and `normalizeSelection`. Two renderers consume it and must
agree:

| | Where | When |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas | `web/app/components/PortraitMaker.js` | live, on every click |
| sharp | `web/lib/portrait/render.js` | once, on save |

They share `LAYERS`, `tileRect`, `buildPalette`, `recolor` and `SHIFT_X`, so
what actually differs between them is only the drawing API. They agree pixel
for pixel up to the WebP encode, which shifts a channel by a unit here and
there — the same lossy step the letter plaques already take. **If you change
one, change the other**; this is the same twin discipline as `ARCHITECTURE.md`
§3, for the same reason.

The catalog must stay free of `node:` builtins, sharp and Prisma. It is
imported by a client component, and anything unbundlable in it breaks the whole
modal.

### The palette swap

Three source ramps — skin (8 tones), hair (7), pupils (3) — plus the single
flat brow tone, which maps to the darkest hair slot so a blond character
doesn't keep near-black brows. `buildPalette` flattens all of them into one
`Map<packedRGB, [r,g,b]>` that runs over every sheet.

That one flat map works because **the three source ramps share no colour with
each other**. A pixel is either in the map or it is paint the player doesn't
choose — lip red, eye white, the bone of a horn — and passes through untouched.
Adding a ramp that collides with an existing one would silently repaint the
wrong thing, so check before you do.

The seven skin ramps and all thirteen hair ramps are the artist's, read out of
`Colour_Examples.png`. Four skin ramps appear there complete; the three deepest
appear with five of their eight slots, and the missing crown and highlight
slots are least-squares fitted from the five that are there. That fit
reproduces the four complete ramps to within a few units per channel, which is
why it's trusted for the other three. **Eye ramps are ours** — the artist's
sheet demonstrates the swap with magenta, cyan and red, which is not the
register this setting is in.

### Framing

The art is drawn left of its tile's centre: across every part in every sheet
the ink spans x 16..104, centre 60 rather than 64. `SHIFT_X` undoes that, or
the bust visibly hugs the left edge of its plaque. That one is a correction to
the sheets. Where the head then *sits* in the plaque is a separate question,
and it lives in `NUDGE_X` / `NUDGE_Y` — fractions of `CANVAS`, negative x for
left, positive y for down. **Dial those two constants, never the crop
arithmetic under them**: both renderers import the resulting `CROP_X` /
`CROP_Y` from `catalog.js`, which is what keeps them pixel-identical.

Both are measured rather than eyeballed, and it is worth knowing what they
measure before moving them:

- **`NUDGE_Y` = 0.08.** Strict bottom-anchoring cut the crown off **23 of the
  66** hair, cranium and headwear tiles. Sliding the window up pays out fast
  and then stops: 0.06 leaves 9 clipped, 0.08 leaves 8, and everything out to
  0.18 only reaches 5 while steadily trading chin for empty plate. 0.08 is
  just past that knee.
- **`NUDGE_X` = -0.03.** These heads are three-quarter, not frontal — the
  skull's ink centres at x 150 in bust space while the nose centres at 204.
  Centring the frame on the *tile* therefore threw the face well right of the
  plaque's middle. -0.03 puts the head mass a couple of pixels left of centre,
  which reads centred and leaves looking room on the side the face is turned
  toward. Nothing in the catalog clips at the left; the widest `hair-back`
  tile keeps a 12px margin, which is the budget if you push it further.

Scaling is 128 → `BUST_PX` (320) → cropped back to `CANVAS` (256) at that
window, with a **nearest** kernel throughout in
both renderers. Any other kernel turns pixel art into mush. The bust is head
and jaw only — no neck, no shoulders — so at a flat 128 → 256 scale the chin
ended in a hard cut right on the plate's edge and read as a severed head.
Scaling to the larger `BUST_PX` first pushes that cut below the frame before
the crop brings it back to `CANVAS`; whatever chin is still visible is then
dissolved into the plate's own shadow by a bottom-of-frame gradient
(`FADE_HEIGHT`/`FADE_TINT`/`FADE_DARKEN` in `catalog.js`) composited over the
finished bust. `FADE_TINT` must track `TINT` in `generate-letters.js` — they
are meant to read as the same shadow, and drift between them would show.

Past a `NUDGE_Y` of 0.25 the crop window runs off the top of the bust and
`CROP_Y` goes negative. It doesn't at 0.08, but the renderers handle it
anyway so the constants stay free to move. A canvas clips an out-of-range
draw on its own; sharp's `extract()` refuses a window that overhangs at all,
so `render.js` pads the bust with transparency first (`PAD_TOP` and its three
siblings, all 0 in the normal case, which makes the `extend()` a no-op). One
trap there: sharp runs `extend()` **after** the post-resize `extract()`
whatever order they are chained in, so the two have to be separate passes.
The plate is composited under the bust, so any freed space shows plate.

Changing any of this only affects portraits saved **from then on**. The bytes
in `Character.avatarData` are already baked; `Character.portrait` keeps the
selection, so a re-bake is possible, but there is no script for one.

### Randomize draws by gender

**Randomize is the only thing gender touches. The picker is not filtered.**
`MASCULINE_PARTS` in `catalog.js` lists the hair and beard indices that read
masculine; `randomizableParts` strips them from the pool for a `WOMAN`, and
`randomSelection` takes a `gender` alongside `allowFantasy`. `MAN` and `NEUTRAL`
draw from everything, which is the same shape as
`db/lib/nameCorpus.js#randomCharacterName` — a neutral character draws from both
name pools rather than from a third one.

The list is one-sided because the artist's set is: eleven of the 28 hairstyles
and thirteen of the fourteen beards read masculine, and **nothing reads
feminine-only**. So a woman rolls from the seventeen unisex hairstyles and always
lands clean-shaven, and a man can roll anything. Hair index 0 — the empty tile,
i.e. bald — counts as masculine on purpose; that is Bascinet's call, not an
oversight about the "none" option.

The grid still offers all 28 and all 14 to everybody, and `normalizeSelection`
knows nothing about gender, so a hand-picked beard on a woman saves fine. That
is deliberate: a roll should land somewhere plausible, but a player who wants a
particular face gets it. The gender arrives as a prop —
`BioForm` -> `AvatarField` -> `PortraitMaker`, defaulted to `"NEUTRAL"` (the
widest pool) at each hop, so a caller that forgets it rolls the way the button
did before this existed.

One thing this does *not* fix: every beard but index 0 is masculine, so a man
still rolls facial hair thirteen times in fourteen. That is uniform-roll
weighting, not gender, and nobody has asked for it yet.

## 4. The client never posts pixels

`setPortraitAvatar` takes a *selection* — part indices and palette indices —
and re-renders it server-side from the committed sheets. A forged request
cannot smuggle arbitrary bytes into an avatar; the worst it can do is pick a
different nose.

`normalizeSelection` runs on everything, on both sides. Anything invalid,
missing, out of range, or fantasy-while-gated silently becomes that slot's
default, so a malformed post degrades rather than throwing. It also runs on
*read*, in `page.js`, because a stored index can outlive a catalog change.

`Character.portrait` stores the selection as JSON so reopening the modal
resumes where the player left off. It is not the picture; `avatarData` is.

## 5. No switches

There were two, `portraitMakerEnabled` and `portraitFantasyPartsEnabled`, and
neither is a knob any more. The maker is **always open**, and the catalog's
`fantasy` options — pointed ears, horns, antlers, and the plum/blue/teal hair
and violet/crimson eye ramps — are **always hidden**. The columns still exist
on `GameConfig` so nothing drops a value, but nothing reads them; the answers
are hardcoded at the call sites (`allowFantasy: false`).

Ravenheart is low fantasy and human-only, so those parts are **hidden rather
than deleted** — a code change brings them back, and nobody has to re-cut a
sprite sheet. Everything else in the artist's
set is a human face and stays available: the ears at index 0-8, every jaw,
nose, mouth, brow and beard, the glasses, monocles, eyepatches and piercings,
and the freckles, scars, moles and warpaint under **Marks**.

Turning the fantasy switch back off does **not** retroactively strip a portrait
that already has horns. It keeps them until its owner next saves, at which
point `normalizeSelection` drops them. That is deliberate: silently rewriting
faces on a config change is worse than one stale portrait a GM can reset.

## 6. Performance

The modal is a live preview plus up to 28 thumbnails, all redrawn on every
click, and the product bar (`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`) is explicitly *not the laggy
Discord dashboard*. Two things keep it fast:

- **Sheets are re-tinted once per colour change, not once per draw.** A
  `getImageData` pass per thumbnail would be 28 of them on a tab switch;
  instead each sheet is recoloured into an offscreen canvas keyed by the
  palettes it actually uses (`LAYERS[].tints`), and every draw after that is a
  plain `drawImage`. A hair-colour change re-tints four sheets, not fifteen.
- **The sixteen images are decoded once per page load**, module-level in
  `PortraitMaker.js`, so reopening the modal is instant. The HTTP cache would
  have covered the bytes; this covers the decode.

The tint cache is passed down as a **ref**, never as `ref.current` — reading a
ref during render is a `react-hooks/refs` error in this repo, and the whole
thumbnail grid shares one cache.

## 7. Helm avatars — the face a concealed character wears

Nothing above applies to concealment. A character wearing a mask does not get a
portrait with a mask layered on top; they get a **different image entirely**,
one shared by every wearer of that item. That is the point — a per-character
concealed avatar would be a fingerprint (`PROXYING.md` §5) — and it means these
need no catalog, no layers, no palette, and no render at request time. They are
21 flat files.

- **Source** — `web/assets/helms/<sprite>.png`, 32×32, sitting beside
  `web/assets/fonts/` for the same reason: build inputs, not served assets.
- **Output** — `web/public/assets/helms/<sprite>.webp`, 256px on the same
  `plate.webp` a built portrait uses, shade ramp and all.
- **Build** — `npm run assets:helms --workspace=web`
  (`web/scripts/generate-helms.js`). One-off with committed output, exactly the
  posture `generate-letters.js` takes.
- **Wiring** — `Tag.concealSprite` holds the basename; `db:sync-tags` refuses a
  name with no file behind it.

### Why the scaling rule is what it is

`TARGET` is the one number to turn, and it has been raised twice — 190, then
215, now **245**. Each time for the same reason: a helm read as a small object
floating on a large plate next to a portrait that fills its frame edge to edge.
At 245 seven of the 21 hit the clamp and are scaled back to fit, and the rest
reach an edge, which is what a bust does too.

The source sprites all sit in a 32×32 cell, but the **art inside** ranges from
11×11 to 30×17. Scaling by the cell reproduces that spread on screen, which is
what made a wide hood fill the frame while a skull mask floated in the middle
of it looking like a mistake.

Both obvious fixes are worse:

- **Fit** (scale by the larger side) — a wide brim hits the edges while the
  crown is still tiny, so the raggedness stays, just inverted.
- **Fill** (scale by the smaller side) — the same brim overshoots to 335px on a
  256px canvas and most of the hat is cropped away.

So the generator normalises the **geometric mean** of the tight bounding box:
`scale = 190 / sqrt(w * h)`. That holds apparent visual *mass* constant rather
than any one edge, which is what the eye actually compares between two icons.
Across the current 21 it needs no clipping at all — the widest lands at 252px
and the tallest at 238px, both inside the 256px canvas.

Two smaller decisions in the same file: the box is measured from **alpha, not
the cell**, since every sprite is padded differently inside its 32×32; and the
resize is `kernel: "nearest"` like everything else here, because this is pixel
art and any other kernel turns its hard edges to mush.
