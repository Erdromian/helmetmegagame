# Proxying: how a player's message becomes a character's

Every word a character says in Discord is a webhook repost of something a
player typed. This doc covers that pipeline end to end — proxying, avatars,
the reactions that act on a proxied message, concealment, mentions, and the
nickname that ties a Discord account to a character.

Companion to `CHANNELS.md` (which channels opt in) and `ARCHIVE.md` (where
the transcript is written).

## 1. Which channels proxy

Not configured by hand. A channel opts in **only** by being one of a zone's
provisioned channels, or a special channel whose registry entry says
`tupper: true`:

| Channel | Tupper | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| A zone's `#summary` (text) | yes | **yes** |
| A Location's channel (text), and every Room or Conversation thread under it | yes | no |
| `#cerberon` | yes | no |

The special channels aren't tied to a place, so they're never summary.

Two independent implementations of that rule, kept in sync by hand — the
gateway/REST twin pattern (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §3):

- `bot/src/lib/channels.js` — gateway cache.
- `web/lib/discordGuild.js` — `isSummaryChannel` / `isTupperChannel` /
  `listGuildChannels`, REST-based.

There is **no name-based marker**. Channel IDs are checked directly.

## 2. The proxy itself

`bot/src/events/messageCreate.js` auto-proxies every message from a user with
an `ALIVE` character in a tupper channel: `bot/src/lib/proxy.js#sendAsCharacter`
runs the one write path (`db/lib/say.js` — `prepareSpeech`, post, `recordSpeech`),
reposting through a per-channel webhook under the character's name and avatar,
then deletes the original. The gates, the babble and autocorrect passes and the
identity all live in `say.js` now, so a message typed into `/play` is decided
by exactly the same code (`HALL.md` §2).

**No bracket or trigger syntax.** Each player has exactly one living character
at a time, so there is nothing to disambiguate.

`sendAsCharacter` sets `allowedMentions: { parse: ["users"] }`. That is
load-bearing for §6: a role mention still *renders* as a chip but notifies
nobody, so the relay DM is the single notification path.

`bot/src/lib/proxy.js#postAsCharacterTo(channel, character, {content, files,
discordUserId, conceal})` is the **core send** — webhook, tracking, no source
message. `sendAsCharacter` is the message-driven wrapper around it, and is the
only thing that deletes an original. The Speak modal (`COMMANDS.md` §5) has no
message to delete, only an interaction, which is why the split exists.

### The original is deleted on every path, including the failing ones

This is the load-bearing rule of the whole file. The game's premise is that a
player's account and their character are separate, and a message left sitting
un-proxied under a real Discord name breaks that premise for everyone reading
the channel. For `/conceal` it is worse still: the text they wanted anonymous,
over their real name.

It used to delete only after a successful send, so anything the webhook
rejected stayed on screen with nobody told — a message over 2000 characters
(Nitro types 4000; the bot's repost still has to fit 2000), an attachment over
the guild's upload limit, a sticker-only message, or a webhook a GM had
deleted. The first three are now refused *before* the send and the rest are
caught after it; either way the original goes and `handBack` DMs the player
their words, in pieces if the reason it failed was length.

**Losing a message is recoverable, and handBack recovers it. Losing the mask is
not.** `sendAsCharacter` returns `null` when it refused, and the delete is
logged rather than swallowed — a swallowed delete is the same leak by another
route.

The webhook cache un-learns an entry on Discord's `Unknown Webhook` code and
rebuilds once, keyed on the error code and never on its message text. The
`WebhookClient` itself is cached too: a fresh one starts with zero knowledge of
the rate limits it is about to hit, so building one per message meant N
simultaneous messages in a busy room fired N blind requests into a ~5-per-5s
bucket.

Every reaction below finds its message by looking the `ArchiveEntry` row up on
`discordMessageId`, so a message the transcript has is a message the reactions
work on — including one posted before the bot last restarted.

`db/lib/discordRest.js#postAsCharacter` is the REST twin, used for staged public
summaries posted from `advanceTurn`'s side effects.

**Speaking without being seen to type.** Discord fires the typing indicator
under the player's *real* account, before the proxy ever runs — so composing
in a channel announces who you are regardless of what the webhook posts. The
Speak flow (the 🔊 button on the `#turns` console, or `/message`) composes in
a modal instead: the text arrives as an interaction, and there is no typing
indicator and no message to delete. `/message` run inside a channel you can
already speak in posts straight there; that does not hide the typing
indicator, since you are already in the channel, but it does stop the message
existing in plain sight before the proxy removes it.

**`recentProxies` is gone** (phase 1 of `HALL.md`). It was an in-memory map
tying a proxied message back to its player and character — last 20,000, single
bot process, wiped on restart — so every deploy quietly made the last hour of
scene inert to ✏️ ❌ 🔍 📸. `ArchiveEntry.discordMessageId` is unique, so the
transcript is that map now: `bot/src/lib/proxy.js#proxyRowFor` reads the row and
the character's player off it, and a database row does not forget. ‡

### Who is allowed to speak at all

`postAsCharacterTo` is the only funnel a character's words reach a channel
through — ordinary chat, whispers and the Speak modal all end up there — so the
SPEAK gate (`TAGS.md` §5f) sits in it as the backstop, with the Speak modal
also refusing early as a courtesy. Mute, Paralyzed, Unconscious and mid-Seizure
are silent; **Bound is not**, because being tied up takes your hands and not
your voice.

A silenced player is handled exactly like any other refusal: the original is
deleted and `handBack` DMs them their words. That is the right answer here and
not merely a convenient one — the mask still has to hold for somebody who
cannot talk, and they should not lose what they typed to find that out.

**A refused message still writes the speaker's activity.** They were here; they
tried. Without that, being Mute would quietly march somebody toward the
auto-kill in `db/lib/catatonicDeathPass.js` for the crime of attempting to
speak.

**Voice state is read from the sheet, not from the character object handed in.**
Every caller arrives through a different `include` — `messageCreate.js` loads a
*filtered* tag list for identity that does not even select `slug`, and the Speak
modal's `findAliveCharacter` loads no tags at all — so `loadVoiceState` does one
query of its own and hands the result down.

That mismatch was a live bug, not a hypothetical. `speaksBabble` reads
`ct.tag.slug`, so against `messageCreate`'s include it read `undefined` and
returned false every time: **{tag:stupid} had never garbled ordinary channel
chat**, only the Speak modal, which happened to take the old fallback query.
The same round trip now answers both questions. Blocked beats garbled — a
Stupid Mute is silent, not babbling.

### The one message replaced by the *bot* rather than a character

A GM pressing Discord's own **New Post** button in a location forum is the
single case where a human's message is re-authored as **Bascinet itself**, not
as a character webhook. `bot/src/lib/questPost.js` deletes the post and
re-creates it verbatim as the bot, tagged **Quest** — see `CHANNELS.md`
§ "Quest posts" for the whole rule. It is hooked into `messageCreate` **before**
`isDesignatedTupperChannel`, which is load-bearing: a GM who also has a living
character would otherwise have that starter message proxied, and deleting a
forum post's starter message destroys the entire post.

## 3. Avatars and letter plaques

Profile pictures are stored **as bytes on the row** —
`Character.avatarData`/`avatarMimeType`, resized and compressed with `sharp` at
upload — not in a third-party bucket, and served by the web app itself at
`/api/avatar/<characterId>`. The bot builds a full URL from `WEB_BASE_URL` when
it needs an `avatarURL` for a webhook.

Uploading is gated on `GameConfig.avatarUploadsEnabled` (Dev Panel, off by
default). `AvatarField.js` hides the file input when it's off, but the real gate
is `updateCharacterProfile` ignoring a posted `avatar` field regardless — a
server action is a public endpoint. Flipping the flag changes nothing about
existing `avatarData`.

A character with no uploaded picture gets a **letter plaque**: a teal-tinted
stone tile bearing a blackletter capital of the first letter of their **first
name** — never the honorific or the granted title, so `Sir Alder "the Blind"
Crane` gets an **A**. The 27 tiles (A–Z plus `_default`) live in
`web/public/assets/letters/`, generated by `web/scripts/generate-letters.js`
(`npm run assets:letters --workspace=web`) from
`web/public/assets/background.png` and the vendored
`web/assets/fonts/UnifrakturMaguntia.ttf` — the same face `--font-display`
uses, vendored as TTF because `sharp`'s pango renderer cannot read the `.woff2`
that `next/font/google` caches.

Two things about the generator are load-bearing:

- It **tints in a second `sharp` pass, alone**. Chaining `.tint()` with
  `.modulate()` in one pipeline silently drops the tint and yields a flat grey
  plate.
- It **trims each glyph, then fits it into a fixed box**. Blackletter capitals
  differ enough in width that one point size makes some tower over others.

Output is WebP, matching what an uploaded avatar is stored as — ~145KB for the
set instead of ~1MB as PNG.

**Nothing regenerates an avatar on rename.**
`web/app/api/avatar/[characterId]/route.js` picks the plaque at *read* time from
the live row, so a rename follows implicitly, and an uploaded `avatarData`
always wins so nobody's own picture is overwritten. The `?v=<updatedAt ms>`
cache-buster every caller appends is what gets past the route's `immutable`
header. An accented, non-Latin, numeric or empty initial falls through to
`_default.webp` rather than 404ing.

Every successful proxy (and `/speak`) also touches
`Character.lastActivityTurn` via `db/lib/characterActivity.js#touchCharacterActivity`
— the clock `db/lib/catatonicPass.js` reads to lift the Catatonic (AFK) tag
(and, since the guild-leave rework, to stop the death countdown that runs
while it's held — `TURN-ENGINE.md` §2 7b).
It's a separate write from the `ArchiveEntry` above on purpose: the archive
row is best-effort and a ❌ reaction deletes it outright, neither of which
should un-flag the activity that already happened.

## 4. Reactions on a proxied message

All in `bot/src/events/messageReactionAdd.js`. Every one of them looks the
message up as an `ArchiveEntry` row by `discordMessageId`
(`bot/src/lib/proxy.js#proxyRowFor`) and checks the reactor against that
character's own player — so a restart no longer makes an older message inert,
and a **five-minute window** (`db/lib/say.js#EDIT_WINDOW_MS`) applies to ✏️ and
❌ on both faces. Past it: *"That was said more than five minutes ago and
stands."* ‡

| Emoji | Does |
|---|---|
| ❌ | Soft-deletes the row; `bot/src/lib/feedOutbox.js` removes the Discord message. Owner, or a GM (who is not held to the window). |
| ✏️ | Edit, via a DM button and a modal — see below. The modal writes the **row**, through `editSpeech`, and the outbox carries the change to Discord. Owner only. |
| 🔍 | Inspect embed — see §5 and `FACTIONS.md` §4. Same readout as **Look at** on `/character` (§4a). |
| 📸 / 📷 | The same readout, frozen onto a **Photo** tag in the reactor's hands. Needs an Instant Camera, which is not spent. `COMMANDS.md` §6. |
| ⭐ | Saves a personal `Note` — see §7. |
| 🌫️ | GM-only fog. |

DMs no longer carry any reaction-driven flow; the bot does not request the
`DirectMessageReactions` intent.

### 4a. 🔍 has a twin on the web: **Look at**

`db/lib/examine.js` is the one readout behind both, and neither surface
builds its own. The bot maps it to an `EmbedBuilder`, the web app to JSX
(`web/app/components/ExamineDialog.js`), but every rule that decides *what is
in it* — the doctor's eye, the concealed read, Inscrutable, Role, ⬢ — is
decided once, in that file. Add a field to one and both get it.

The two differ only in who they can be pointed at, and that is the point of
the web one existing:

- **🔍 needs a message.** It hangs off an archived row, so it only ever
  works on someone who has **spoken**. That was never a hiding rule — a
  guard on a gate could not size up a silent traveller without first striking
  up a conversation with them.
- **Look at needs co-presence.** Everyone `ALIVE` standing at your Location,
  silent or not. It is the one people-picker on the sheet that does **not**
  use `peopleHere()`: it lists the concealed too, under their alias, exactly
  as the **Who's here?** anchor button already lists them. Acting on somebody
  means identifying them, so a hood takes you off every other menu; *looking*
  at a hooded figure is what a hood is for. No presence leaks that
  `Who's here?` does not already publish at Location grain.

Both read a hood the same impoverished way (§5), both are free, spend no
Move, file no `Request` and tell the subject nothing.
`web/app/(app)/character/examineActions.js` is the web half: two server
actions, both read-only.

**✏️ is a button and a modal, and writes no inbound DM at all**
(`bot/src/lib/editModal.js`). A reaction carries no interaction token, so a
modal cannot open straight off ✏️. The path is: reaction → a DM carrying one
"Edit text" button → the click is an interaction → modal, prefilled with the
current text. `edit:open:<messageId>` opens it, `edit:send:<messageId>`
submits. The prompt DM is a `system_notice`, so no GM surface shows it.

`handleEditOpen` must **not** ack first — `showModal` is the acknowledgement.
The prefill comes from an in-memory stash armed when ✏️ is pressed, not from a
REST fetch, because a fetch could blow Discord's three-second window and there
is no deferring your way out of it. Both handlers run in a DM, where
`interaction.guild` and `.member` are null, so ownership is
`interaction.user.id` against the row's own character
(`bot/src/lib/proxy.js#proxyRowFor`). After a restart the stash is empty and the
box prefills from the row's text instead of refusing. ‡

**Why it stopped being a DM collector.** ✏️ used to DM "Reply here with the
new text (60 seconds)" and eat the answer with `awaitMessages`. Sixty seconds
is not enough to retype a paragraph, and nothing was prefilled, so the player
rewrote the whole post from scratch. Worse, every one of those replies was
logged as a `DirectMessage` — about 21 a day — and a long in-character post
sitting in the GM inbox reads exactly like mail. A first fix tagged them
`source: "prompt_reply"` via a `pendingPrompts` map so the desks could skip
them; the tagging worked, but the rail badge in `web/lib/navItems.js` had no
noise predicate at all, so the chime still rang on every edit. The map and its
source are gone now that the flow produces no DM to tag. `prompt_reply` lives
on only as a read-side filter for the rows already in the table
(`web/lib/dmThread.js#withoutDmNoise` and its raw-SQL twin `dmNoiseSql`, which
every GM-facing DM query now shares precisely so they cannot drift apart
again).

`/conceal`'s prompt never needed any of this; it is already a `system_notice`
and the player retypes in the channel.

The bot needs the `MESSAGE_CONTENT` privileged intent for any of this
(Developer Portal → Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents), alongside `GuildMembers`.

## 5. Concealed identity (`/conceal`)

Concealment is a property of **what is over your face**. `Character.concealed`
is only the player's wish, flipped by the `/conceal` slash command (registered
everywhere, the bot's DMs included) or the switch beside turn-ping on
`/character`; it takes effect solely while a `Tag.concealsIdentity` item is
**equipped**. While it is in effect, every message the character sends — typed
into a channel or through the Speak modal — is reposted under an anonymous
alias instead of the name, and **Who's here?** on a Location's anchor lists
them under that alias too (`CHANNELS.md` §4). The old per-message `/conceal`
text prefix and the Speak modal's checkbox are gone: a player who wants to be
unnamed is unnamed until they say otherwise. A concealed character is also
excluded from every people-picker on `/character` (Heal, Loot, Move Player,
Bind, Free, Harm, Transfer) and cannot be targeted through those menus
(`db/lib/presence.js`).

**It is not open to everyone.** With a bare face there is nothing to toggle and
both surfaces refuse. This is `Tag.concealsIdentity`, which sat inert in the
catalog for a long time and is now the gate it was always kept for.

`Tag.forcesConceal` is the stricter version, and the difference is the whole
point of the pair: a hood is a choice, a sack tied over the head is not. While
a forcing item is equipped the character is concealed whatever the column says,
and **both toggles refuse in both directions** — there is no choice to make, so
the stored preference is left alone and comes back when the thing comes off.
Being **Bound** blocks unequipping entirely (`TAGS.md`), which is what makes a
sack worth tying on.

Concealment is **derived at read time**, never written. Nothing has to happen
when a mask is put on or taken off, no catch-up pass exists, and a row left
`concealed: true` after the mask came off simply resolves back to the real face
on its own. `concealmentFrom(tags)` in `db/lib/presentedIdentity.js` is the
whole of it, and `CONCEALMENT_TAG_FIELDS` beside it is the field list every
call site selects — miss one and concealment silently stops working at that
surface only.

The slash command only flips the column and replies; the message itself still
rides the ordinary proxy path, so ✏️/❌/⭐/🔍 all behave unchanged.

The alias comes from `db/lib/concealedIdentity.js` (pure, in the barrel beside
`characterName.js`):

- `Young` / `Old` / nothing, from `Character.age` — under 25, 55+, nothing
  between, nothing when age is null.
- `Man` / `Woman` / `Person`, straight off `Character.gender`. NEUTRAL reads
  Person.

**This used to be inferred from the title**, which meant an untitled character
was always "Person" however they present, and so was a Censor. Gender is a
real column now (`CHARACTERS.md` §1c), so the alias simply says it: an untitled
woman conceals as "a young woman". Concealing hides the name, the face and the
faction — it was never meant to hide how someone presents, which is what the
line above has always claimed it carries.

The alias is frozen into `ArchiveEntry.concealedAlias` at send time, so a later
gender correction never rewrites the archive. That is correct: it records who
someone was as they were known then.

The avatar is the concealing item's own `Tag.concealSprite`, served straight
out of `public/` as `/assets/helms/<sprite>.webp` and **identical for every
wearer of that item** — a per-character concealed avatar would be a
fingerprint. The sprite says *what* is over the face, never *who* is behind it,
so a room full of Tribunal helmets is a room full of identical Tribunal
helmets. Two things follow: no per-character render, and no cache-busting,
because the file never changes.

`syncTags.js` refuses a `concealsIdentity` tag with no sprite, and refuses a
sprite naming a file that isn't there — a typo would otherwise stay invisible
until somebody equipped the thing in play and Discord served a broken image.
The images are built from the source sprites in `web/assets/helms/` by
`npm run assets:helms --workspace=web`; `PORTRAITS.md` covers the sizing.

When two concealing items are worn at once, the **outermost** wins — highest
`Tag.equipLayer` — because that is the one an onlooker can actually see. A coif
under a knight's helm is a coif nobody can see.

`web/public/assets/unknown.png` survives, but only as history: `ArchiveFeed.js`
still needs it for entries archived before concealment had a face.

The row records the alias it was posted under (`ArchiveEntry.concealedAlias`),
and `proxyRowFor` works out whether that was a hood or a forced name by
comparing it against the character's current forced name. Three handlers read
it: ‡

- **🔍** returns a **hardcoded** embed *before* any of the normal field logic:
  the concealed line, plus only the visible ailments and the visible gear —
  the same `seenByBystander()` gate the ordinary embed uses, so a `visible:
  worn` dagger shows here exactly when it is drawn (`TAGS.md` §5). Concealment
  hides the *identity*, not the inventory. No appearance, name, Desire, or
  Resources, even for a viewer whose gates are open. "Ailments" resolves as
  `tag.category === "Health"` — Health is its own category now (`TAGS.md` §5c)
  and so *is* the ailment set, which is what this used to reach for the
  `status-health` group slug to approximate. Mind the capital: `Tag.category`
  stores the display name, not the YAML slug. The doctor's eye below does
  **not** apply here — a concealed subject stays deliberately impoverished, and
  a surgeon reading a hood is still just reading a hood.
- **⭐** files the alias in `Note.characterName` rather than the real name.

The unconcealed 🔍 path carries one rule worth knowing here, described in full
at `TAGS.md` §5c: **an affliction you could treat as routine is one you can
see**, even when it's `visible: false` to everyone else. A medic inspecting
someone gets their Appendicitis; the man beside them gets nothing. Those rows
are marked `· your diagnosis`, because the patient isn't showing it to the room
— repeating it aloud is saying something nobody else could know.
`db/lib/medicalVision.js` decides it, and a cure needing a Gambit stays hidden
even from an Expert, since guessing isn't diagnosing. Those Health rows are
also the only ones that print what the tag costs (`TAGS.md` §5) — everything
else on the embed is a bare name.

The **Desire** field on that same embed is bought by exactly one tag, the
Demoness's Seductive (`db/lib/inspectVision.js`), and closed by
**Inscrutable**, the one rule in that file read off the *subject* rather than
the viewer. A closed read renders `Nothing you can read.` — byte for byte what
a subject with no active Desire produces, so a reader cannot tell "they're
guarded" from "there's nothing there", and holding Inscrutable never
advertises itself. Mindreading buys no field at all: it reads a Desire on a
Gambit after a conversation, and that is the GM's call, not the bot's. Being
free and silent is what the Demoness tag is paying its extra point for.
- **✏️/❌** are unchanged; both already gate on `proxy.discordUserId`.

The archive records **both halves** — `ArchiveEntry.concealedAlias` alongside
the real `characterId`/`characterName` — so `/archive` renders
`Young Man (Sir Alder)`. That is the one surface where concealment is undone,
which is why `archiveVisible` is meant to stay shut until the game ends
(`ARCHIVE.md`).

### Forced identity (`Tag.forcedName`)

The opposite case: a held tag that **fixes** the name and face rather than
hiding them. Apex Form carries `forcesName: Beast` (`TAGS.md`, "`forcesName`").
`db/lib/presentedIdentity.js` is the one resolver, and every surface above
calls it instead of branching on `concealed` by hand:

```
presentedIdentity(character, { forcedName }) -> { name, avatarPath, alias, concealed, forced }
```

Precedence is **forced > concealed > own name**. A forced identity posts under
the forced name with the static plaque `/assets/letters/<Initial>.webp` — not
`/api/avatar`, so nothing about the character's real face is ever fetched for
it. `alias` is "the name the room saw when it was not the real one" and is set
for both a hood and a forced name; it is what `recordArchiveMessage` freezes
into `concealedAlias` and what ⭐ files under. `concealed` stays true only for
a real hood, so the impoverished 🔍 embed and the no-relay rule below keep
applying only to hoods — a Beast is not hiding.

Call sites that already hold `character.tags` use `forcedNameFrom(tags)`; the
two proxy paths that load a bare `Character` (`messageCreate.js`, the Speak
modal) run `loadForcedName(prisma, id)`, one indexed query. The REST twin
takes `forcedName` from its caller in `db/index.js`, since `discordRest.js`
has no prisma of its own.

While a forced name is held, `/conceal` refuses and the switch on `/character`
renders disabled; `updateCharacterProfile` writes `concealed: false` whatever
the form posted, and drops any upload. The **@-mention role and the nickname
keep the real bare name** on purpose (§6, §8) — so the `/add` picker naming a
Beast by their old name is intended. Nothing is written when the tag lands, so
there is no grant hook: the next message is already the Beast's.

## 6. Mentions and conversations

A character's personal Discord role is a **mentionable name token and nothing
else** — held by nobody, granting nothing (`CHANNELS.md` §3). `Character.discordRoleId`
is `@unique`, so a mentioned role id resolves straight back to one character.
While the character is Catatonic (AFK, or their player left the guild —
`CHARACTERS.md` §5), the token itself says so: the role
reads `<name> • Catatonic` in flat grey, renamed by the turn pass (or the
leave handler, on the spot) and
restored the moment they act — composed only by
`db/lib/characterRoleAppearance.js`, which is also what `ensureCharacterRole`
uses, so a profile save mid-catatonia keeps the suffix. Mentioning the
renamed role still resolves normally; the id never changes. Mentioning a GM/spectator/player role resolves to nothing
and is silently ignored.

`bot/src/lib/mentions.js` owns both things a mention does;
`bot/src/events/messageCreate.js` calls it after proxying.

### The row spells it differently, on purpose

Since the Hall's phase 6, `<@&roleId>` is **Discord's** spelling and the
archive row stores a face-neutral **`{char:<id>}`** instead — the same inline
token syntax the web renders everywhere else
(`web/app/components/richTokens.js`). `db/lib/characterMentions.js` is the pair
of translations, and neither face ever sees the other's:

- **In.** `db/lib/say.js#prepareSpeech` returns two strings for a Discord-origin
  send: `content`, which is what the webhook posts (unchanged, or the chip the
  player meant becomes literal text), and `rowContent`, with every mention that
  names a character role folded into a token. `recordSpeech` stores the second.
  `editSpeech` runs the same rewrite, so a ✏️ that adds a mention lands the same
  way.
- **Out.** `bot/src/lib/feedOutbox.js` rewrites tokens back to `<@&roleId>`
  when it posts or edits a WEB row, and DMs the relay — the same "where and a
  jump link, never the text" DM this section describes, through
  `db/lib/dm.js#sendDm` rather than the gateway twin, because the outbox is a
  pg listener with no discord.js client. Same earshot rule, same ten-target
  cap, and a **concealed** send still relays nothing at all.

Only a role id that IS a character's name token is ever rewritten —
`Character.discordRoleId` is `@unique`, so the lookup answers with one
character or with nothing. A GM/spectator/player role passes through
untouched, exactly as it always has.

The composer on `/play` writes tokens directly, over an `@` autocomplete of
`whosHere().named`: you can only name somebody you can see, and a row only
renders a name its reader could have seen too (HALL.md §5).

**Mentions must be read before the message is proxied** — `sendAsCharacter`
deletes the original, taking `message.mentions` with it — but the jump link
needs the *proxied* message's id. So the order is **capture → proxy → relay**.

### The relay DM

**Pinging your own character does relay.** There used to be a filter dropping
the sender's own characters — nobody needs telling they pinged themselves —
but because the proxy suppresses the ping itself (§2), a self-ping was the one
case that looked exactly like a broken relay while working as intended, and it
is the first thing anyone reaches for to test the feature. A redundant DM to
yourself is much cheaper than a feature nobody can verify.

Every rejection on this path is a bare return. `handleMentions` logs one
`[mentions]` line per ping — the role ids, how many resolved, and each
target's gate outcome — so the Railway logs can tell "out of earshot" from
"resolved nobody" without a debugger.

Otherwise, gated so a ping can't carry further than a voice would. Without a gate,
pinging is a free cross-map signalling channel. Two rules, because the two
kinds of channel mean different things by "in earshot":

- **Location channels** (and the Rooms and Conversations under them) gate on
  the **location** — you can call for someone standing where you stand, not
  for someone across the zone.
- **The special channels** have no zone at all, so they gate on whether the
  target currently *hears that channel* — `computeNarrowcastAccess` from
  `db/lib/specialChannels.js`, keyed on `NARROWCAST_SLUGS` rather than a
  hardcoded pair, so a future entry is covered by adding it to the registry.

The DM carries **where and a jump link, never the message text**. A ping into a
private thread the target hasn't joined would otherwise leak the room's
content, and a `DirectMessage` row outlives the ❌ that deletes the message it
quoted.

**A concealed message relays nothing at all** — the room isn't meant to know
who spoke, and a DM naming the place would hand the target a thread to pull
on.

### Adding to a conversation

In a Conversation (a `PlayerThread` row, `CHANNELS.md` §4), a mention also
**adds that character's player to it**.
Discord does this for free today by auto-adding a mentioned role's members, but
that stops working the moment the roles have zero members, so the bot takes it
over.

`/add` and `/remove` are the same operation by command, both taking a **role
option** rather than a user option on purpose: the picker then names
characters, never Discord accounts, so inviting someone can't reveal who plays
them. Anyone already in the thread may add or remove, plus GMs.

**A mention is an invite, on the same contract as `/add`** (`COMMANDS.md` §2b),
and it reads the same typed into `/play` as typed into Discord — the web half
lives in `bot/src/lib/feedOutbox.js#relayWebMentions`, which used to send the
notification and stop there:
a `PlayerThreadInvite` row is recorded, the Discord add is attempted now, and
if the target is standing somewhere else `applyPendingInvites` replays it the
moment they arrive in that Location. Discord still requires a thread member to
be able to view the parent channel — that view is the location role now — so
an add from elsewhere would put a thread in their sidebar they can't open. The pinger is told who was
invited rather than notified (collected into one DM, not one per target), since
a proxied message has no interaction to reply to and silence would read as a
bug.

One thing worth knowing rather than fixing: removing a member the bot didn't
add needs `MANAGE_THREADS`, which comes from the bot's own role and is not
granted by `locationChannelSpec` — `/remove` reports that failure rather than
silently timing out.

## 7. Notes (⭐) and the Journal

`/notes` has two tabs, `NotesBoard.js`: **Starred** (this section) and
**Journal** — a player's own written entries, unrelated to proxying and
covered here only because it shares the page. Neither tab is ever
GM-visible or shared between players; see below.

There are two ways in now: the reaction in Discord, and the ★ on a row's
action bar on `/play` (`web/app/(app)/play/actions.js#starRow`, `HALL.md` §5).
Both write the same row. A line with no Discord message behind it — a web-only
player's, or one the outbox has not pushed yet — is filed under `seq:<seq>`
instead of a message id, so the `(discordMessageId, discordUserId)` unique
still holds and a ⭐ in Discord and a ★ on the web make one note, not two.

Reacting ⭐ to any guild message saves it as a personal `Note` for whoever
reacted — not just a proxied one. `handleStarReaction` upserts a row keyed on
`(discordMessageId, discordUserId)` with a speaker, a zone snapshot, content,
and `sentAt`. Unlike every other reaction here, ⭐ works on a message with no
archived row at all, and resolves the speaker in two tiers: ‡

1. **A character message** — its `ArchiveEntry` row, which is durable
   (`db/lib/archive.js`), so starring works on anything ever said.
2. **No row** — a bot-as-itself post (turn announcement, GM declaration,
   `/gm`, ghost whisper) or another webhook's message. Filed under the
   poster's display name with `characterId: null`; a real player's own message
   still isn't starrable.

**The bot always strips the reaction back off** right after processing
(`reaction.users.remove(user.id)`), for any user, on any message — so Discord
never shows an accumulating star count, and the note on `/notes` is the only
lasting record. There's no "react again to unstar"; unstarring is the web UI's
`[★]` button (`unstarNote` in `web/app/(app)/notes/actions.js`), which just
deletes the row.

A starred card shows the speaker's face (`CharacterAvatar`) beside their name —
**gated**. `Note.characterId` is stored unconditionally even when the message
was concealed (`characterName` becomes the alias instead — see §6 above), so
`notes/page.js` only passes `characterId` through when the stored name still
matches the character's current real name; on a mismatch it ships `null`,
which `CharacterAvatar` renders as a letter plaque. This fails safe in both
directions: a merely-renamed character just loses its face, and a concealed
one never gains one. The check happens server-side, so a concealed
character's id never reaches the client at all.

`/notes` is **strictly personal and identical for both roles**: every signed-in
user, GM or player, only ever sees `Note` and `JournalEntry` rows matching
their own `discordUserId`. There is no shared or all-players view. Both tabs
render as sortable-by-time, filterable cards over the shared list shell
(`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` §7), not a table — each tab holds its own independent
filter/sort/paging state, since the two row shapes are never interleaved.

**The Journal** (`JournalList.js` / `JournalComposer.js` / `journalActions.js`)
is a private, freeform record: a title, a body, an optional pin-to-top, the
open turn number at the time it was written, and up to a handful of
free-text labels. A body can `@`-mention a character, which is stored as a
`{char:<characterId>}` token (the same `{kind:payload}` grammar `RichText.js`
already uses for `{tag:…}` and friends) and renders inline as a face + name.

The mention roster and the mention *resolver* are the same query — every
character `ALIVE`, or `DEAD` and not yet buried (mirroring
`character/page.js`'s own zone-roster precedent) — passed once to
`CharacterMentionsProvider.js`, mounted only by this page. There is
deliberately no second, narrower lookup keyed off whatever ids a body happens
to contain: an entry can only ever mention a character its author was allowed
to see in the autocomplete in the first place, so a second lookup could only
ever widen what a pasted-in id could reveal (a buried character's name and
portrait, for instance) — never narrow it usefully. A mention of a character
outside that roster (buried, or simply invented) just fails to resolve and
renders as the raw token, the token pipeline's existing behaviour for any
unresolvable reference.

## 8. Nickname sync

Every `ALIVE` named character's Discord server nickname is kept as
`{base} | {characterName}`, where `characterName` is the **bare** name (first +
last, via `formatBareName`) and `base` is the player's own Discord display name.
Truncated to fit Discord's 32-char cap — **both halves shrink proportionally**,
not just one.

There is deliberately **no override** for either half. The character half is the
character's name and the base is who the player is on Discord; a hand-typed
preference for the base (`Character.preferredNickname`, removed) was a second
source of truth for the same 32 characters and nothing else.

Gated behind `GameConfig.nicknameSyncEnabled` (off by default). Clearing a dead
character's nickname is **not** gated (`CHARACTERS.md` §5).

**The nickname is the one surface where a title deliberately does not appear.**
The 32-char cap is shared between the two halves — roughly 14 each — and
`Sir Jorren "the Blind" Vask` is 27 characters on its own, so titling here
would truncate essentially every nickname in the guild to garbage. Both copies
of `buildNickname` are fed the bare name by their callers; neither slices a
title off itself.

**Nothing polls.** It is event-driven like everything else in the bot:

| Trigger | Caller |
|---|---|
| Discord username/display name changes | `bot/src/events/userUpdate.js` |
| Rejoin | `bot/src/events/guildMemberAdd.js` |
| Character created, saved on `/character`, or renamed by a GM | `web/lib/discordGuild.js#syncCharacterNickname` (REST) |
| Bot connect/reconnect | `bot/src/events/ready.js` → `syncNicknamesForGuild`, a one-time catch-up bulk pass, not a recurring tick |

`buildNickname()` is hand-duplicated between `bot/src/lib/nickname.js` and
`web/lib/discordGuild.js` — the same twin convention as `isTupperChannel`.
