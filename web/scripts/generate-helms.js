//   npm run assets:helms --workspace=web

// The plate is the same tinted stone a built portrait sits on, and the bottom
// fade is the same gradient, for the same reason generate-letters.js shares the
// plate: a helm and a face turn up side by side in one Discord channel, and two
// treatments free to drift would stop matching.

// Target for the GEOMETRIC MEAN of the sprite's tight bounding box, not for
// its width or its height. That distinction is the whole trick here, and it is
// worth spelling out, because the two obvious rules both look wrong:
//
//   fit  (scale by the LARGER side)  — a wide brim hits the sides while the
//        crown is still tiny, so a jester's cap renders half the size of a
//        skull mask and the sheet looks ragged.
//   fill (scale by the SMALLER side) — the same brim then overshoots to 335px
//        on a 256px canvas, and most of the hat is cropped away.
//
// sqrt(w*h) splits the difference and holds apparent visual MASS constant
// instead of any one edge, which is what the eye actually compares.
//
// Raised from 190, then from 215. At 190 the mean landed well inside the frame
// and a helm read as a small object floating on a large plate, next to a
// portrait that fills its frame edge to edge; 215 narrowed the gap without
// closing it. At 245 seven sprites of the 21 hit the ceiling and are clamped
// down to fit, and the rest reach an edge of the canvas — which is the point,
// since a bust does too. The clamp below is what makes the higher number safe,
// and it is what to reach for before lowering this again.

// shoulders, so nudging up matches the framing of the thing this sits beside.

// chin cut into the plate; here there is no cut to hide, but the effect is the
// other half of why a face sits IN its frame and a helm sat ON one. Drawn over
// the sprite, not under it, exactly as the portrait does.
//
// Duplicated rather than imported: catalog.js is ESM and this script is CJS,
// and generate-letters.js already keeps its own copy of the same pair for the
// same reason. Must match TINT/DARKEN in web/scripts/generate-letters.js and
// FADE_TINT/FADE_DARKEN/FADE_HEIGHT in web/lib/portrait/catalog.js.
//
// BLACK as of 2026-09-06: the plate's own tone map now crushes its bottom edge
// to zero, and a fade toward any lighter colour would LIFT that edge back up —
// the mismatch this pass was closing, reappearing upside down. The fade still
// earns its keep, because it sinks the SPRITE's lower edge into the shade; the
