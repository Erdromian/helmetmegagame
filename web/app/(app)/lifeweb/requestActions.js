// authenticate, re-validate everything the client sent, then apply the effect
// and write the Request + AuditLog rows in ONE transaction.
//
// Both snapshot `bloodDelta` — what actually moved after the 0-100 clamp —
// rather than the amount asked for, because that is the only number an Undo
// can safely reverse. See docs/systemdocs/REQUESTS.md §2.

// The /lifeweb page gate is advisory: a server action is a public endpoint,
// so Mortus is checked again here. A GM without a living Mortus character
// can't submit these — the GM panel on the same page is their route.
//
// Standing in the Fortress is the second half of the gate. The tower is up the
// Keep stairs (docs/zones.yaml, the Gatehouse topic), so tending the Web is
// something you do with your boots on that ground — the same reach rule every
// other person-touching Request already applies (MAP.md §3).
