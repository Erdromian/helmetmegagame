// reading a room is not an act, so it writes no audit row at all.
//
// It exists because 🔍 hangs off a proxied message, so until now you could
// only look at someone who had SPOKEN. That was never a hiding rule, just a
// consequence of attaching the feature to a reaction — a guard on a gate could
// not size up a silent traveller without first striking up a conversation.
// /conceal is the actual hiding rule, and it still works here exactly as it
// works on 🔍: you get the hood's impoverished read.
