// been derived (from `value` + `caret`) instead being stored and drifting out
// of sync. There is nothing stored here at all.

// next word would immediately reopen the menu.

// The name half freezes who was meant, so a later rename or disguise cannot
// rewrite an entry somebody already wrote (db/lib/characterMentions.js). A
// journal body is not stamped by a send path, so this IS the record here —
// which is fine, because the roster it comes from is the presented one.
