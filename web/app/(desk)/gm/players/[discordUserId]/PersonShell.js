// It used to split the pane with DossierColumn and wire that column's
// "Insert into reply" buttons into the composer through a ref, which is the
// only reason it was a client component at all. The dossier is gone — the
// shared inspector (components/InspectorColumn.js, mounted by the desk
// layout's InspectorHost) covers it on both desks now, and the Canon tab
// writes the draft through the shared module store (players/dmDraft.js)
// instead of a ref across a tree the two no longer share.
//
// The component stays as the one place that names the person view's layout
// class, so the route's loading.js and this render the same wrapper.
