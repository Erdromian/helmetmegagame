// The "Unlocks" block on a tag: which Desires holding it opens.
//
// One component for the surfaces that share no other panel code — TagChip's
// hover panel, PointBuy's hover panel AND its catalog rows, and the full
// TagDetailSheet — so the rule about what counts as an unlock is written once
// and they cannot drift apart. All of them pass the same tag row (selected
// with DESIRE_UNLOCK_SELECT); only spacing differs, via `compact`.
//
// EVERY ELEMENT HERE IS A <span>. PointBuy's catalog row is a <button>, which
// may contain phrasing content only — a <ul> or a <p> in there is invalid
// markup that React will happily render and the browser will reflow around.
// The layout is CSS's job instead (display: grid on a span costs nothing).
//
// No hooks and no client directive: TagChip renders on the SERVER at most of
// its call sites, and a context read here would break every one of them. The
// data rides the tag prop for exactly that reason.
//
// Renders nothing at all for the ~900 tags that unlock nothing, so an empty
// heading never appears.
