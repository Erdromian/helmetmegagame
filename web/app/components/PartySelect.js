// One end of a movement of things or ⬢: a person standing here or a Room
// stash here, as the "character:<id>" / "room:<id>" keys resolveParty()
// parses server-side.
//
// Players are a flat, alphabetical list, deliberately NOT nested under their
// faction — that grouping would leak allegiances to anyone who opened the
// dropdown. The list itself is already narrowed to who is at your Location
// (web/lib/peopleHere.js).
//
// An entry may carry `kind: "hood"`, which writes "hood:<token>" instead. That
// is a concealed person, listed by their alias — Transfer is the one caller
// that offers them, and the token is an opaque handle rather than an id
// (db/lib/whosHere.js#hoodToken).
//
// Lives here rather than inside the Transfer dialog because Heal and Craft
// ask the same question ("who pays for this?") over the same people.
//
// `rooms` — the Room stashes at the character's Location they can get into
// (docs/systemdocs/CARRY.md), as "room:<id>". `selfId` puts "(you)" after
// your own name so a payer or destination list reads right.
//
// `silo` — the character's own faction silo, when the "Rooms here" list
// cannot carry it: either it is elsewhere in the zone, or it is a locked room
// at this very Location that `accessibleRooms` filtered out. That second case
// is the mail slot (FACTIONS.md §4a) — you may deposit into a silo you cannot
// open, and without this group the picker would hide the one destination the
// server actually allows. Only ever passed for a DESTINATION: you deposit
// from across the zone, and take things out only by standing in the room.
