// RequestActionsProvider like every other mode — this is the form.
//
// Two jobs in one dialog. Pick something you already have going and the
// form becomes Continue / Cancel for it; pick nothing and it's the recipe
// menu (the provider's TagPicker, passed in as `picker`), a quantity for a
// stackable, and who pays. A recipe with turns is this turn's Move, and the
// form says so before the confirm does.
//
// "Something you have going" is two lists, not one. A CraftProject is yours
// alone; a build site standing where you are is anybody's to lend a turn to
// (db/lib/structures.js), so the two share the one dropdown under separate
// groups. The pick crosses as a prefixed key because a select has one value
// and these are two id spaces.
