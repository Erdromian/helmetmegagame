// The body of the one Transfer dialog (docs/systemdocs/CARRY.md): a source, a
// destination, the tags that can leave the source, and a ⬢ amount. State
// lives in RequestActionsProvider like every other mode — this component is
// the form, not the owner.
//
// The source is YOU or a Room here — never another person. You can't reach
// into someone's pockets, and listing what's in them would show their hidden
// tags; Loot is how you take from a (helpless) person. The destination is
// anyone standing here and unconcealed — INCLUDING YOURSELF, which is how a
// stash gets emptied — or a Room here (web/lib/peopleHere.js); the server
// re-checks the same predicate (db/lib/presence.js#isHere returns true for
// yourself). You -> you is blocked by sameParty at both ends instead.
//
// `rooms` carries each stash's contents, so pulling out of a Room shows
// what's there; `carry` is this character's load and caps for the projection
// line, which warns but never blocks (going over just makes you Overburdened).
