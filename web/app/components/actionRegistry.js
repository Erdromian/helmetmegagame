// Every player action on the character sheet, declared once.
//
// ActionGrid.js renders these as captioned rows; RequestActionsProvider.js
// reads each mode's title and help from here. Adding an action to the game
// is one object literal in a section below, one dialog branch in the
// provider, and one server action — nothing else has to change, and the
// grid never has a fixed column count to overflow.
//
// The metagaming rule: a button is greyed out ONLY for a fact about your own
// sheet — nothing to destroy, no recipe you know, no Medical training. It is
// NEVER greyed for a fact about who is standing near you. A greyed-out Loot
// icon would announce "nobody here is helpless" to anyone who glanced at
// their own sheet, and a live one would announce the opposite — free
// scouting, every time the page loads. So the co-presence actions are always
// lit, and you learn who is here by opening the dialog and reading it. (The
// pickers themselves list only the people at your Location who haven't hidden
// their face — web/lib/peopleHere.js — which is a different rule: what the
// dialog shows once you chose to look.)
//
// `gate`: a key on the provider's pools that greys the button when false.
// `show`: a key that HIDES the button instead — for the rare tags (a bird,
// literacy) where a permanently dead icon would teach nothing except that
// something exists which you cannot have.
