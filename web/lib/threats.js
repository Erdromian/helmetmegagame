// Re-export of db/lib/threats.js. Like web/lib/characterName.js this binds
// nothing — the module is pure — but the shim is still required:
// CreateCharacterWizard.js is a client component, and importing the
// @lifeweb/db barrel would construct a PrismaClient in the browser bundle.
// The deep path resolves because @lifeweb/db declares no `exports` map.
//
// Named rather than `export *`: the target is CommonJS, so a star re-export
// makes Turbopack emit runtime interop and warn on every build.
