// Re-export of db/lib/formatTagFighting.js, in the shape
// web/lib/formatTagArmor.js established.
//
// The deep path avoids the @lifeweb/db barrel, which unconditionally requires
// @prisma/client and would leak node:fs into this "use client" bundle
// (TagDetails.js). It resolves because @lifeweb/db declares no `exports` map.
//
// Named rather than `export *`: the target is CommonJS, so a star re-export
// makes Turbopack emit runtime interop and warn on every build.
export { formatTagFighting } from "@lifeweb/db/lib/formatTagFighting";
