// The post-commit tail of every server action that changes what a character
// holds — tags or ⬢. One helper so no writer forgets a step, and so the
// steps run in the one order that is correct:
//
//   1. settleCarry — Overburdened on/off, and the overflow drop when a Cart
//      or Pack Mule just left (db/lib/carry.js, CARRY.md). FIRST, because a
//      drop can take a private-room key off the sheet.
//   2. narrowcast + room access — recomputed from the post-drop holdings,
//      and both in after(), for the reason spelled out below.
//   3. the drop's Discord work, in after(), off the request's critical path.
//   4. corpse follow — a body that changed hands is a body that moved, and
//      the dead sheet has to catch up before anyone tries to loot it
//      (db/lib/corpseFollow.js, CORPSES.md).
//
// Everything is best-effort and catch-logged: a missed sync is the channel
// doctor's problem (CHANNELS.md §6) and a missed settle self-heals at the
// next one. Never call this inside a transaction.
//
// Steps 2 and 3 are Discord round trips and step 4 is not, which is the whole
// reason the two syncs sit in after() rather than being awaited. Room access
// walks every private room in the game one call at a time
// (db/lib/roomAccess.js), so equipping a hat used to hold the browser for
// several seconds while the bot talked to Discord about rooms nobody was
// standing in. Nothing the caller re-renders reads either sync: the character
// page derives accessibleRooms from tags and RoomGuest rows, never from live
// thread membership, so ordering these after revalidatePath changes nothing a
// player sees. settleCarry and reconcileCorpses stay awaited, because the
// render does read what they write.
