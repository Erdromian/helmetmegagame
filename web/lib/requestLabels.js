//
// These lived in web/lib/requests.js, which imports the @lifeweb/db barrel and
// therefore constructs a PrismaClient. That is fine for the server actions that
// live there, but it means no client component could reach the labels without
// dragging Prisma into the browser bundle, so the Dev Panel's Record tab
// rendered raw enums instead. Same split, same reason, as web/lib/moves.js.
//
// requests.js re-exports both so every existing server-side import keeps
// working unchanged.
